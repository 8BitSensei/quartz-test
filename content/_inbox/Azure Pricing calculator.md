The Azure Pricing Calculator is a tool in the Azure Portal which allows you to get an estimate of the cost of individual resources, built out solutions, or from an example scenario.

With the pricing calculator, you can estimate the cost of any provisioned resources, including compute, storage, and associated network costs. You can even account for different storage options like storage type, access tier, and redundancy.

But all of this is only an *estimate* and may not reflect the real cost
