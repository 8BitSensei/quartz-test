Microsoft's [[Intermediate Language]] that a whole series of languages including [[C Sharp (Language)]] compile to. This shared intermediate language is compiled and executed inside of the [[Common Language Runtime]], this means any language compiling to this language can run in the same environment.

MSIL is then compiled to [[machine code]] by the [[JIT Compilation]] compiler.

The downside of this is that it causes memory overhead which other languages which compile directly machine code (such as [[Rust (Language)]]) do not incur.


> The Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), also known as the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) is a set of instructions that are platform independent and are generated by the language-specific compiler from the source code. The MSIL is platform independent and consequently, it can be executed on any of the Common Language Infrastructure supported environments such as the Windows _.NET_ runtime.
