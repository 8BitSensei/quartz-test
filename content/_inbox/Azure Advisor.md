Azure Advisor is a service which evaluates your resources and makes recommendations to improve reliability, security, and performance to achieve optimisation and reduce cost. It does this by suggesting actions you can take right away, postpone, or dismiss. You can access all this information via the Azure portal or the API.

Recommendations come in five categories:
- Reliability
- Security
- Performance
- Operational excellence
- Cost
