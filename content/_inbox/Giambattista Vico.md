(1668 - 1744)

A professor of Rhetoric at Naples, known for his 1725 publication *Scienza Nuova*, in this, Vico emphasised an evolutionary view of human society.  He also pushed a cyclical theory of the history of human society handed down to Europeans from Ancient Egypt:

- 1) **The age of the Gods**, all (believed they) lived under divine theocracies directed by auspices and oracles.
- 2) **The age of Heroes**, all were ruled by aristocratic commonwealths due to the natural superiority they were believed to hold over the common people. 
- 3) **The age of Men**, all men are recognised as equal in human nature, and so establish new forms of human government such as popular commonwealths and monarchies.

Interestingly, each of these phases have different linguistic traits; the first, a mute world of symbols and signs, the second, a language of heroic emblems, similitudes, comparisons, images, metaphors, and natural descriptions, the third, human language using a commonly agreed upon vocabulary.

Vico also argued that, where as earlier philosophers argued that only God could understand the laws of social change, as he had made the world, actually, God could know the true meaning of nature as he had made the natural world, but men had made human society, and thus, could understand it, past, present, and future.2023-02-18
