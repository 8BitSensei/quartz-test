> Feature flags (also commonly known as feature toggles) is a software engineering technique that turns select functionality on and off during runtime, without deploying new code. This enables teams to make changes without pushing additional code and allows for more controlled experimentation over the lifecycle of features. [^1]


Examples:
- [[LaunchDarkly]]
- [[Unleash]]
