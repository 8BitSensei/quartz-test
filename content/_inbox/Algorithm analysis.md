part of [[Computational Complexity Theory]]

provides estimations of the required resources for an algorithm to solve a specific computation problem. Analysis is an approximation, not perfect.

Uses [[Asymptotic Analysis]]

determines the amount of **time and space** resources required to execute it

[[Time Complexity]]

[[Space Complexity]]

Convenient to estimate resource costs agnostic of a specific computer
