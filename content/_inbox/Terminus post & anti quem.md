Literally '*limit after & before which'*, these phrases are often used in Archaeology and History to represent the known earliest (*terminus post quem*) and latest bound (*terminus anti quem*) for the date of an event or item.

There is also the *terminus ad quem* 'limit to which', which is the latest possible date, and the *terminus a quo* 'limit from which', representing the earliest, for non-punctual events.
