Undecidability, in that given a current state or pattern and another pattern, no algorithm exists that can predict whether the former will produce the latter 


Can we treat historic societies or data sets as a complex pattern, where the simple cells are, say temple sites, or small finds reports.

Given undecidability we cannot predict from a patterns current state we cannot predict a future state. But, given we have a pattern, we can perhaps predict backwards to its simple cells.

It's called Emergence!
