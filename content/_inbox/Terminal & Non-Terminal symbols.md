in Computer Science, terminal and non-terminal symbols are the lexical elements used by the production rules in a formal grammar.

#### Non-Terminal symbol

Non-terminal symbols are those symbols which can be replaced, either by another non-terminal symbol, or finally, by a terminal symbol. All formal grammars start with a non-terminal symbol, and the language defined by the formal grammar is considered to be the set of terminal symbols that may be derived from that starting point.

#### Terminal Symbol

A terminal symbol is a symbol which has no (or no more) grammatical rules that would allow it to change into a another symbol, it is at it's final state. They are considered the elementary symbols of the language defined by a formal grammar.


I can think of the relationship between terminal and non-terminal symbols as the relationship between animate and in-animate objects. Living things, animals, plants, humans are non-terminal, we are capable of change, in-animate objects, rocks, tables, hills, are terminal, they are not capable of change. All non-terminal objects can eventually become terminal.
