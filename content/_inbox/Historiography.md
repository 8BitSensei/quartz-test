[[Phenomnelogy]] claimed introspective methods as the access to the mental universe; hermeneutics, far more influential in theory of history than phenomenology, claimed that ‘reading’ other minds could be conceived of as analogous to reading texts

According to [[Empiricism]], mental states could only be known as far as they correlated with empirically observable epiphenomena. The empirical dispositions or expressions of other minds are seen as the only access to other minds (Hempel 1966).

> Just as it is possible to know the ideas expressed in a text by reading and interpreting, it is possible to know the ideas expressed in actions and in all human made objects by inferring the unobservable ideas from their observable expressions...

(Droysen 1977, Dilthey 1981, Collingwood 1993)

This possibility was guaranteed, according to the hermeneutic views, by the basic unity of humanity, implying the basic unity of subject and object of knowledge in the human sciences.
