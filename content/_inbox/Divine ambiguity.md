Thinking about how images and idols of gods may be deliberately ambiguous, as to what they represent.

The image is not the god itself, it is a tool for worshipers, some may come to a temple and see Apollo, or Sol, or Cunomaglos, or Maponos, or Orpheus, or Mithras in the same image, this is a feature, not a bug, so to speak.

When we study religion, and more specifically ritual, I think we should celebrate this ambiguity, we cannot cut through it and state matter of factly what God was worshiped and this temple, especially of the gods name is not included, different worshipers may come and see different gods, or understand their connection to other gods, in different ways.
