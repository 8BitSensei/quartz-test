A system that uses [[Radio waves|radio waves]] to determine distance (this is known as ranging), angle (the azimuth), and velocity of objects relative to the transmitter. 

Consists of a **transmitter** producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwave domain
A transmitting **antenna** and a receiving **antenna** (often the same antenna)
A **receiver** and **processor** to determine properties of the object


#### Transmitter
Electronic device that produces [[Radio waves|radio waves|]] with an [[Radar#Antenna|antenna]]. The transmitter generates a radio frequency alternating current, which is applied to the antenna, which then radiates radio waves.


#### Antenna
An antenna (or aerial) is the interface between [[Radio waves|radio waves]] moving through space and electronic currents in metal [[Conductor|conductors]], used with a [[Radar#Transmitter|transmitter]] or [[Radar#Receiver|receiver]]. When an electric current is supplied to the antenna's terminals, the antenna radiates the energy from current as radio waves (electromagnetic waves). When an antenna is receiving, it intercepts some of the power of a radio wave in order to produce an electronic current at its terminals, which is applied to the receiver. 


#### Receiver
An electronic device that receives the alternating currents from the [[Radar#Antenna|antenna]] and extracts the desired information. It uses [[Electronic filters]] to separate the desired radio frequency signal from all the other signals picked up by the antenna, an amplifier can increase the power of the signal for further processing and recovers the desired information through [[Demodulation]].


#### Processor
A computer that processes the data from the [[Radar#Receiver|receiver]] for further output devices
