Related to the [[Shared responsibility model]]

Essentially, you are just renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, and so, the provider is responsible for maintaining hardware, network connectivity, and physical security. This leaves you responsible for everything else including:
- OS
- Configuration
- Maintenance
- Network configuration
- Database and Storage

Naturally, this is the most flexible option that you can choose, but has the highest personal responsibility for the customer.

#### Common Scenarios
- Lift-and-shift migration
- Test and development
