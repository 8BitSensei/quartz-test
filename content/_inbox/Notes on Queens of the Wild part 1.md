#### Intro

*Explain what Revisionism is, what was it a response to? Then introduce Hutton's book and his critique of Revisionism?*

Hutton's latest book, titled '**Queens of the Wild: Pagan Goddesses in Christian Europe**', is an investigation into four supernatural female figures that range from antiquity to the recent past. Each figure represents a culturally and theologically transgressive figure who never neatly fitted into our categories of Christian or Pagan. But, none the less, existed, and very much had emotional traction over people from all levels of society.

Those figures are Mother Earth, The Fairy Queen, The Lady of the Night, and The Cailleach. Hutton investigates these figures as a way of centering and directing the post-Revisionist debate. He chooses the following figures because they each show difficulty fitting into orthodox Christian or Pagan categories.

#### Mother Earth


Hutton provides a similar treatment for each of the aforementioned figures, all to prepare the reader for the books central thesis, which he aptly sums up in the final line.

> "... the old polarizing terminology of Christian and pagan is no longer suitable." pg. 197

Hutton makes his thesis most explicit in his epilogue, where he provides a similar treatment to the former figures to a fifth, the Green Man. Which due to solid historical research, after the Green Man became a monumental figure and recognised as a deity in many British Pagan communities, we know is largely a modern creation. Built by piecing together independent Medieval and Modern elements such as foliate heads and May day celebrations such as Jack in the Green, which was developed by chimney sweeps for May day begging, in competition with other low-wage occupations. Hutton however also points out that seasonal celebrations such as May day, and the inclusion of green foliage in that, seems to be a legitimate tradition which has continued from pre-Christianity. Seasonal celebrations being one of four direct lines of connection between ancient paganism and the present, these being ceremonial magic, popular service magic, the aforementioned seasonal rituals and customs, and:

> The fourth, and perhaps the greatest, line of continuity consisted of the ongoing relationship of Christian cultures with the deities and spirits of the pagan ancient world, as embodied in art, literature and folklore.

Hutton provides an empathetic and post-Revisionist take on the Green Man, in which he states:

> ... it is perfectly legitimate to pick foliate or woodland figures from all over European and Near Eastern art, folklore and literature, across the ages, or indeed from all over the planet, and group them together now as expressions of the human relationship with green and fertile nature. pg. 190

He goes on to say:

> there should also be no reasonable objection if people then make this belief system the basis for, or a component of, a religion and/or a symbolism with which to approach the current global ecological emergency. pg. 191

And finishes with a hope for the future between Revisionist and non-Revisionist positions:

> Both have their value as reactions to a changing world, and it would be a very positive achievement if they could be diverted from clashing with each other.

---

### reinstate arguments
Hutton's post-Revisionist position is ultimately an empathetic position which seeks to provide a descriptive position of divine beings and how they fitted into their religious worldviews. While putting prescriptive, orthodox beliefs of what Christians or Pagans, or any other religion *should believe* aside. The latter was a methodology which forced us to jump through loops trying to account for figures that fall outside of these orthodox positions. 

### suggestions comparison
In some ways, I think Hutton may be behind the curve on this. In recent years there has been some good work breaking down assumptions about cultural and religious boundaries through out history, and in some recent works, especially coming out of Ireland a position seems to be forming out of the Revisionist rubble. 

In 2018, Watson published a PhD thesis dedicated to philosophy in Early Medieval Ireland, and used his deep understanding of contemporary philosophy to analyse the Gods in Early Medieval Irish literature, using an approach which actively denies Nativist or Revisonist boundaries, he makes use of all the material available and eventually concludes:

> In any of its forms, the conception of the gods as the secular counterparts to the angels seems to best account, not only for the presence of gods in medieval Irish narratives that appear to insist on their existence, but for the fact that they often seem at their most distinct in the context of Biblical typology, or such things as providing prophetic knowledge of Christian doctrine. It also seems to be the best way of accounting for the evidence which John Carey has put forward regarding how these gods were sometimes supplicated in prayer, and even with ritual, without disregarding what we know about the ecclesiastical context which produced these texts. *If saints and angels could be supplicated in this way, why not these other intermediaries?* [^3]

That the Gods in Irish literature were understood to be a secular counterpart to Angels which were understood to have mediated both divine prophecy and secular crafts knowledge prior to the conversion, and very well could have continued to receive supplication alongside Saints and Angels, is in my opinion, a totally ground-breaking argument. Watson's position denies both that the Irish Christians couldn't have believed in the Gods, because it fails to fit in *our understanding* of orthodox Christian belief, and thus they can only be understood metaphorically, and that the Gods in Early Medieval Irish literature must represent a survival of Pagan religion as a subversive and rival element to the Church, as has often been argued before.

The same statement Hutton makes about his four figures could easily be made about the Irish Gods in Watson's reckoning:

> They were part of the thought-world of people who were otherwise orthodox Christians for their place and time. It seems wrong to refer to such figures as 'pagan survivals'.
> ...
> On the other hand, to describe them as Christian, unproblematically and straightforwardly, is to miss the point of how completely they functioned outside of, and alongside, the Christian world picture. pg. 196 - 7

Similarly refreshing work was published some seven years earlier by Cline, who produced a full book assessing the presence of Angels in the Roman Empire, which makes it clear that Angels are hardly a wholly Christian category of divine being. Rather they were a category provided by Hellenistic authors (as anyone who's familiar with Iamblichus will know) that could be used across multiple religious world views, Christianity just being one of many, as exemplified by the oracle of Claros in 20 CE

> "'Are you god? Or, is someone else?' This is the questions that a theologically curious inquisitor asked the oracle of Apollo at Claros around 20 CE. One might have expected Apollo to affirm his divinity and perhaps elaborate on the awesome power of the Olympian gods. However, the oracle delivered a rather surprising response, recorded in a Greek inscription in the ancient city of Oenoanda, in present-day Turkey. The oracle reported that the All-Seeing Aether was the true god, and that one should pray to him at dawn, facing to the east. In addition, the mouthpiece of apollo replied that the Olympian deities were *angeloi* of this supreme deity." [^1]

And a great deal of public outreach can be seen to be done by authors like Francis Green, who continually expose the diversity and at times alienness of medieval Christian belief, like in [this thread](https://twitter.com/DrFrancisYoung/status/1259103579731906560?s=20&t=QXckzOdi6KNpLTFuN31lRA) which discusses how it was orthodox for Christians to believe that the pre-Christian gods were in fact real agents in the universe, right up until the modern period, even if in a literally demonised form. 



### current climate outro
At times it seems that we are still far too attached to strict ideas of what Christianity *is supposed to be*, which are more often than not a post-Reformation artifact in an increasingly post-Christian society. We often seem to have equally simplistic views about what Paganism *should be*, which is often equally an artifact of the post-Reformation period. This lead us in the past to simplisitc ideas about the relationship between Paganism and Christianity, and that it would be a straight-forward and simple task to separate the two. The Revisionism of the later 20th century showed this to be wrong, but I hope in a post-Revisionist world we can start to pick up the pieces and start to understand the complexity and diversity that exists at the borders between religions and cultures with empathy and compassion.


## Notes
> The first maiden said: 'Who is God and where is God and whose God is he and where is his dwelling-place? Has your God sons and daughters, gold and silver? Is he ever-living, is he beautiful, have many fostered his son, are his daughters dear and beautiful in the eyes of the men of the earth? Is he in the sky or in the earth or in the water, in rivers, in mountains, in valleys? Give us an account of him; how shall he be seen, how is he loved, how is he found, is he found in youth, in old age?' [^2]

> In any of its forms, the conception of the gods as the secular counterparts to the angels seems to best account, not only for the presence of gods in medieval Irish narratives that appear to insist on their existence, but for the fact that they often seem at their most distinct in the context of Biblical typology, or such things as providing prophetic knowledge of Christian doctrine. It also seems to be the best way of accounting for the evidence which John Carey has put forward regarding how these gods were sometimes supplicated in prayer, and even with ritual, without disregarding what we know about the ecclesiastical context which produced these texts. *If saints and angels could be supplicated in this way, why not these other intermediaries?* [^3]



> "The authors who wrote of them explicitly awarded them divine status, calling them goddesses or daughters of God, and Newman was quite certain that they were neither 'pagan survivals' nor versions of a 'Great Goddess'. Instead, she regarded the as a third order of superhuman being in medieval Christian thought, along with saints and classical pagan goddesses, with both of which they to some extent overlapped."  pg. 193

> ... they were treated as being as real as angels or devils, as deserving of love and reverence and as being on intimate terms with the Christian God. pg. 193

> As divine figures who were the subordinates of God and the personifications of some of his attributes, they posed no danger to orthodoxy and provided a safe space within which to explore the Christian faith. So, it seems that it is possible to have Christian goddesses, and that term is not an oxymoron. pg. 194

> ... none of them seem particularly 'small': on the contrary, they do seem at times to operate on the scale of deities. pg. 195

> "Even in the single case in which one was brought safely and respectably into Christian cosmology - that of Nature - the responsibility allotted to her was still considerable, with much day-to-day freedom of action. pg. 196"

**Read Griffith on belief**

(Don't go too deep into explaining Griffith's system I think)

Presents a methodology for describing and comparing beliefs based on descriptive logic and emotional affect. 

Provides a mode of descriptive logic to understand a belief-systems internal logic, which differs from mathematical logic in much the same way descriptive grammar differs from normative grammar. 

> This approach differs from philosophical or mathematical logic much as descriptive grammar differs from normative grammar. Normative logic aims to show how we must reason, to establish the forms a valid argument must take, to decide what conclusions we must draw from a given set of premises; descriptive logic investigates how people have in fact reasoned

> Existing logic tends to be normative: it seeks to tell us how we ought to reason, without regard to whether or not we do actually reason that way. Descriptive logic investigates how people have in fact reasoned, on questions where they feel a strong emotional commitment

The goal for Griffith's descriptive logician is to create a reconstruction of a belief system which identifies a primary body of propositions and it's associated affects. 


Griffith's concept of affect fits quite well with Hutton's emphasis on emotional traction

> What I mean by a ‘belief system’, then, is simply a set of propositions held to be true, to which some emotional charge (affect) is attached and which gives more or less cogent expression to a general sense of how the world is.

> The reconstructions put forward by the descriptive logician are a schematic and skeletal representation of thought processes that are actually shaped, at every stage, by the pressure of passionate emotional commitments.

> If my affective commitment to A is sufficiently strong, and the need to accept A’ does not seem absolutely compelling, I will almost certainly disregard whatever arguments occur to me in support of A’.

The doctrines of a belief system which are identified by the affect the cause in the believers are logically primary, they do not depend on anything else in the belief system, but other propositions will depend on them. 

While Griffith's work is natal and admittedly [^x] in need of some critical revision, I am grateful for his work laying the ground work for a methodology for studying belief in a descriptive and hopefully objective manner which foregrounds the importance of emotional affect in defining primary postulates or doctrines in a belief system.

**What is Hutton's critique of Revisionism?**

Earlier authors treated their study of religion in a manner more in line with a geologist, studying the stratified layers of a rock formation. The concept of a stable core seems to have permeated their thinking, which should be no surprise, as a desire to reach the *first principals* of Religion has been a part of Religious studies since it's conception [^x] (Religious studies, the making of...). This is most obvious in earlier writers like Lang [^x] or Frazier [^x]. But the scope of this desire seems to have shrunk over time, where by the time of Ross, we see the author explicitly seeking the '*permanent core*' of Celtic Religion.

Hutton's critique of Revisionism is not that it is inaccurate, but that it has shattered the previous unity, and no clear way forward has emerged. Some authors have gone so far as to deny the intelligibility of Pagan at all, and while they have some valid points, this is the preverbial baby with the bath water. While other currents have taken authors towards the extreme of universalising Paganism all together. No productive concensus has formed, and much of the current debate is still focused on the Pagan Christian dichotomy. Hutton doesn't seek to remove the term Pagan from usage, but he does want to inject more nuanced vocabulary, which would thus break this age old dichotomy.

**Look at some more of Watson's methodology, critiques of Boyle and Williams**

Watsons critique is slightly different, on one side of the debate, he points to authors who deduce that the belief in the existence of the gods would be impossible given the ecclesiastical setting, thus rendering them as purely metaphorical in nature. Where as on the other side, there are authors drawn attention to the fact that the authors truly seem to believe in these beings, and are thus evidence of residual pagan belief. His crtique of both positions is that the rely on the assumption that the gods would have been unintelligible in the context of medieval Catholic cosmology.

A good of example of the former comes from Williams' book on the Irish Gods, where he suggests that the poets (*filid*) did not believe in the gods, but were instead increasingly attached to them as allegories, mnemonics, and images. He goes on further to suggest that the gods had become available for the literati for recycling as a stock of metaphors and personifications, stripped of any religious framework. While these suggestions are couched in '*if*'s and ''*possible*'s, there is no further attempt to interpret the literature in a literal or historical sense that the medieval authors would recognise.

> It is where they seem to fit into none of these categories that we have been forced to defer any but the most provisional judgement regarding their identity, or the role they are thought play. There is currently no scholarly consensus on this issue. Some scholars have emphasized the fact that these texts were produced by medieval Christians who, whether clerical or secular, had enjoyed the benefit of ecclesiastical education. **They have tended to deduce from this that belief in the existence of beings of this kind would be impossible for such authors**, and thus have favoured reading the relevant accounts as strict allegories: mere fictions with regard to literal meaning, but nevertheless profound in their metaphorical representation of contemporary beliefs and realities. Other scholars **have drawn attention to the fact that these authors very often write as if they truly believe in the existence of these gods, and have pointed to other forms of textual evidence which further validate this impression. They have tended to conclude that this demonstrates residual pagan belief as such.**

> However, **both sides of the dichotomy depend on the assumption that the gods described in the sagas would be unintelligible in the context of a medieval Catholic cosmology.** By this point in the argument it will be evident that such an assumption is most likely groundless. Yet it remains to discover the character of that intelligibility

> ... when allegory is present, there generally seems to be little reason to assume it is at the expense of it also being understood as a literal record of historical events. We must bear in mind that, of the patristic authorities often quoted in medieval Irish biblical commentary, even Origen of Alexandria, perhaps the greatest pioneer (though not the founder) of Christian allegorical exegesis, only accepted that an allegorical interpretation replaces, rather than augments, the historical sense of the Scriptures, when the historical sense was deemed impossible.
> ...
> Yet the principle remains that there is always an historical interpretation except where it is impossible, and that these instances are the exception rather than the rule.
> ...
> it cannot then be assumed that, where an allegorical meaning is detected in a medieval Irish text, it will necessarily be the expense of a literal meaning
> ...
> It is evident that not everyone in medieval Ireland believed such things. Yet there seems no avoiding the conclusion that traversing successive forms of embodiment was seen as a legitimate historical possibility (for at least some individuals) by a significant number of medieval Irish writers.

---


One of Huttons core points is that belief in beings such as mother nature and the fairy queen can fall well out of the expected realm of Christian orthodoxy without being a pagan survival, thus rendering the dichotomy no longer useful. 

But the case goes beyond this, mother nature does enter Christian orthodoxy from non Christian thought, but it's important to recognise that she then leaves the orbit of christianity in the modern period. These beliefs can develop outside, inside, and move in or out of mainstream beliefs, all being equilly valid developments of the figure of Mother Earth. 

Watson is well aware of this when he does good work in breaking down the dichotomy of revisionists and nativists, but he does this by showing the intelligibility of the gods through Christian orthodoxy. While this is hugely valuable to our understanding of the gods, we must bear in mind Huttons point that these beings do not need to exist within orthodoxy to be perfectly intelligible. Watson implicitly accepts this when he suggests the gods probably do have Christian antecedents, thus having moved into mainstream belief at some point (with the problem of secular knowledge), but we would be open to far more if we accepted that the gods could be intelligible para to orthodox belief. 

A careful study of this using Griffiths methodology might show propositional artifacts of varying complexity being incorporated into the primary belief system and vice a versa, but this remains to be seen. The beginnings of this might be seen in his chapter on superstitions, where Griffith only focuses solely on superstitions, seen as the propositionally simplest belief which exists isolated from a wider belief system. These superstitions may well have arisen from earlier belief systems and have become 'isolates', but there seems to be nothing to prevent us suggesting that this may occur to more complex propositional beliefs, or that these isolates may be re-incorporated into the wider belief system in some fashion.

> It is therefore a propositional fragment, which does not cohere closely with a wider belief system, – and which may coexist with a general belief system that is indifferent or contradictory to the particular causal connection that the superstition asserts.
> ...
> \[...\] superstitions can arise historically from other types of ideas and practices whose rationale has been forgotten

That these beings or any other element of culture, such as foliate heads and may day traditions, can legitimately be moved in and out of Belief systems and recombined is something that Hutton recognizes in the epilogue on the emergence of The Green Man when he states.

> ... it is perfectly legitimate to pick foliate or woodland figures from all over European and Near Eastern art, folklore and literature, across the ages, or indeed from all over the planet, and group them together now as expressions of the human relationship with green and fertile nature.

Though, I have to point out that something similar has long been recognised in an archaeological setting. Petts' study on ritual in late antique Britain demonstrated the mutability between Christian and pagan ritual and how a culturally shared corpus of ritual elements can legitimately be recombined and moved between Christians and non Christians without us ever having to suggest this undermines their respective identities. 

> In the context of Roman Britain, where the conversion was likely to have been moved forward by individuals from the same broad cultural milieu, there is likely to be a shared understanding of appropriate framing devices and mechanisms that can be used to provide an element of sacrality to an act. While there may be profound differences in the cosmological interpretations and understandings of ritual behaviour, an underlying shared grammar of ritual practice has the potential to provide a shared ground for discourses about change in religious belief.

The same must be held to be true of historic groups, such as Christians and Pagans, or Romans and Britons, as it does for contempory religious groups, as Hutton puts it: ...
