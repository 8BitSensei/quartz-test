External identities are people outside your company who you want to grant access to your services e.g. a contractor for development work, but they will often have to use a non-Azure or non-Microsoft Authenticator such as Google or Facebook.

There are a  couple of ways in which you can connect to an external ID

##### Business to business (BTB) collaboration
External users using their preferred identity to sign-in to your application, they are represented in your directory as guest users.
##### B2B direct connect
Establishes a mutual two-way trust with another Microsoft Entra organisation, enabling external users to access your resources from within their home instance of *Teams???*
##### Microsoft Entra business to customer (B2C)
Publish SaaS apps to customers while using Azure AD B2C for identity access management
