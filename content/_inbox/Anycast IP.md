> The Internet Protocol (IP) uses three types of addressing schemes: Unicast, Multicast, and Anycast. [^1]

> **Anycast**, also known as IP Anycast or Anycast routing, is an IP network addressing scheme that allows multiple servers to share the same IP address, allowing for multiple physical destination servers to be logically identified by a single IP address. Based on the location of the user request, the anycast routers send it to the server in the network based on a least-cost analysis that includes assessing the number of hops, shortest distance, lowest transit cost, and minimum latency measurements to optimize the selection of a destination server.
