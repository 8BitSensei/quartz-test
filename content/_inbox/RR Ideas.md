Why do I do what I do? What is it that attracts me to this.
Do we have a dangerous connection to [[traditionalism]]

I believe in doing good above all
I do not believe the past is inherently better than the present
I do not believe I know more than anyone else
I do not know what I believe

Am I a pagan? Do I believe in the gods? Do I need to believe in the gods?
What is faith? Is it necessary, I don't think I have faith, I don't know if I believe in something I don't have a way of understanding (true or not). Though this seems absurd, the world is full of things we believe in but don't necessarily have a model of understanding, maybe belief that is model agnostic? I believe the boulder exists, I don't know how or why the boulder exists, I don't understand geology, but I also believe there must be a way to understand the boulder.

We can't fully understand religions of the past, I can never interrogate the Druids on Mona, no necromancy will allow me to talk with their shades. This can leave me in a state of depression, a kind of longing for a world I am forbidden from entering that I can only glimpse at a great distance, it's not quite nostalgia I think. 

But, I can't help but have a kind of hope that I feel in my chest, that if I can just learn more, push forward through undergrowth and sloping roots, with more wisdom, and more exploration, one day, we *could* get close to truly knowing. One day perhaps we we'll excavate preserved tablets telling us what we desire, how the world was formed, what the gods are, how to pray, and how to be.

I do not, like some do, believe that the past was a perfect world of glory that we should strive for, or even necessarily emulate.

There is a deep set desire in me, I want to know, I *must* understand the religion of our past. I want to know and share their beliefs, there stories, and I want to experience their rites. I want to feel the heat of burnt offerings, smell the incense on altars, let their prayers wash over me. It is an overwhelming fantasy that I can feel bubbling up in my gut, rising like a flame through my chest and into my hands and throat, even now as I write. It is a problem I admit. It is a desire that his dominated my thoughts, and to some degree, directed my life for almost a decade now. I have no explanation for why it is inside me, except that I know I felt it, only as a seed, in the form of wonder ever since I was a boy. 

Over the years, it has sometimes made me naive as to what we do and don't know about the past. I know now, that at least here in Britain, what we do know is rather slim and hodge-podge, and that has driven me to depression in the past. I have felt like an exile, constantly wondering an epistemic wasteland, a starved and cast out heath dweller. But, this desire, my seemingly constant companion, as it seems that even entering my third decade it is yet to burn out, has goaded me forward, into a more hopeful if weary nature. I have a kind of irrational belief that we *can* know about those religions of the past; through rigorous study, re-analysis of the data, and future discoveries. If we just keep letting this spirit guide us, through the intellectual and spiritual labour of generations, like the magi and their star, we *can arrive* at that desired land.

That knowledge of the past that we are driven to seek, shall be my guiding star, step-by-step we grow closer. But, in all likelihood we will never reach that promised land, we will catch glimpses of it, we may even come to know it well, but the is a rushing river separating us. We may observe them, they may even shout out to us across that black river, words garbled by the torrents, but we are here, and they are here. We must learn what we can, and experiment with that knowledge, so that we might learn how best that faith may grow in our own soil. 

It is an eternal struggle within us, we must follow that guiding star and learn from it what we can. But we must filter what we learn through wisdom and morality, if we are to embody what we are taught we must cut and trim that knowledge into a practical and moral religion. No one ever perfectly replicates what their teachers teach, we must not, we live in different times, with different moralities, to do other wise would cause stagnation. We must balance our responsibility for the preservation of knowledge, and our need to grow and adapt.

We can model religion as a tripartite structure; philosophy, practice, and myth.

All religions have some combination of these, they may emphasise one over the other, they may be even missing pieces.

Religions aren't not sealed units in reality, that tripartite structure exists in the minds of individuals not in books or temples. They may have local practices and rites, greek philosophy, and biblical myths. A great deal of work may go into making these pieces fit, but it is a religion none the less. I think everyone has these pieces in them, though they may not always be connected, I may have a philosophy for how I look at the world and behave in it, I may have practices I've inherited from those before me, and I may have myths about the world. But, when we put these pieces together in dialog, we create something greater than the some of it's parts, and something that can be productive.
