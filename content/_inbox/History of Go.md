> Why does Go not have feature X? Your favorite feature may be missing because it doesnâ€™t fit, because it affects compilation speed or clarity of design, or because it would make the fundamental system model too difficult.

Essential Characteristics:

- **Expressivity** - intuitive to express ideas 
- **Compilation** - fast compilation time
- **Safety** - strong statically typed, strict compile time rules
