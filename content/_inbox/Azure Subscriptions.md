Subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale. Similar to how [[Azure resources and resource groups|resource groups]] are a way to logically organise resources, subscriptions allow us to organise resource groups and billing.

A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorised access to products and services. Subscriptions are linked to an Azure account, which is an identity in Microsoft Entra ID.

An account must have one or more subscriptions, you can configure different billing models and different access-management policies between subscriptions.
