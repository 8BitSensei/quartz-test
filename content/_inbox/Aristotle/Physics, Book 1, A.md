Key topics are principles, causes, and elements

For Aristotle there are three principles:
- substances
- opposites
- privation

He introduces the technical term 'matter', Greek '*hyle*' (literally wood/timber I think), to deignate fundamental essence '*ousia*'. (Chapter 7)

Matter (hyle) is - "For my definition of matter is just thisâ€”the primary substratum of each thing, from which it comes to be without qualification, and which persists in the result." (Chapter 9)

Matter does not exist independently, it is not substance, but exists only insofar as connected to form and underlying change. Does substance become matter when it is part of an organism? Takes on a form?
