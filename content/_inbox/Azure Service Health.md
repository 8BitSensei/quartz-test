Solution to help you manage and understand the state of not only your own infrastructure but Azure's global infrastructure. It does this with three services:
- **Azure Status**: provides a broad picture of the status of Azure globally
- **Service Health**: Provides a narrower view of Azure services and regions (why does this have the same name, but is implicitly a different service?)
- **Resource Health**: Provides a view of your actual Azure resources

Historical alert are also stored and accessible for later review.
