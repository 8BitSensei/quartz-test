## Introduction
The Polystream Packaging Utility (PPU), is a CLI tool for packaging, processing, and uploading your Polystream application to the Polystream platform. At the time of writing this documentation, PPU is in its first iteration (version 1.0.0) and is considered an MVP.

The PPU allows users to do five things. First, initialise an application directory as a ‘Polystream Application’, this means that the directory will contain a .polystream directory which contains configuration data. Secondly, the PPU allows the user to generate a config.json to tell the Polystream platform how to run the application, this generated `config.json` is relatively simple and does not preclude manual configurations. Thirdly, the user is able to ‘build’ a version of their application, this processes and compresses the Polystream Application in its current state with a given version name, ready to be deployed to the Polystream platform. The user is able to publish a given version to the Polystream platform, to do this the user needs to generate a tenant id and token from the developer dashboard. Finally, the user is able to ‘lint’ their config files, the config files are first checked against a JSON schema then the values are validated.


## Structuring your Polystream Application
PPU takes a very simple approach to Application structure, the directory you initialise PPU in (the one with a .polystream directory), is your Application more or less how it will appear on an Agent (excluding changes made by the config.json). This is because when the PPU builds a version of your application, it compresses a copy of that root directory (excluding .polystream) exactly as it is into a .7z archive, this archive and your config.json is all that will form your Application on an Agent. 

So, as a developer you need to make sure that any assets your application needs are inside that package, unless they are retrieved remotely.

An example, this directory (fig.1) is the root of the Tiger Shooter Application example, when we perform a `ppu build <version>` this whole directory excluding .polystream will be compressed into a .7z folder stored at .polystream\packages\ alongside your `config.json` (fig.2).

## Creating a Polystream Application
There are five stages to creating a new Polystream Application, initialisation, configuration, building, and publishing. We will go through all of these steps in detail with an example Polystream Application, after that, we will go through the process of updating our Application.


##### 1. Initialisation
This step will initialise your application directory as a new Polystream Application. Firstly, navigate to the aforementioned directory and run the following command:

```
ppu init pom_example
```
You should now notice a new folder in your directory, `.polystream`, this directory holds all the configuration for your Polystream Application, built versions, and log output. There is nothing more that needs to be done to initialise your application.

##### 2. Configuration
**Note that this will need updating due to INT-642, DLL will change as well**

Next, we need to generate a `config.json` file, this file tells the Polystream platform how to install, and run your application. This is one of the more complicated commands to use, you need to be aware of certain features of your application, these are:

1. Architecture
2. DirectX
3. The Executable
4. The Working Directory
5. Start-up Arguments

For our example Application, ‘pom’, we use x86 architecture, DirectX9, our DLLs are located at the root of the directory, our executable is `ParallaxOcclusionMapping.exe`, our working directory is in the directory `ParallaxOcclusionMapping\`, and we have the start-up args `-width:$width -height:$height`. This means we want to run the following config command:

```
ppu config --architecture=x86 --directx=9 --exe=ParallaxOcclusionMapping.exe --workingDir=ParallaxOcclusionMapping --startUpArgs="-width:$width -height:$height"
```

##### 3. Linting (recommended)
Now our configs are updated, we can lint the files to first validate whether the json is valid, and also make sure that all required fields are set, and all of the actions are valid. To do this, run the following command:

```
ppu lint
```

##### 4. Packaging
Now, we need to package our application before we can upload it to Polystream. Decide on a name for your version, this can be a single word of either integer or string e.g. 1.6.8-beta, or myNewVersion. This version name can only be used once, we are unable to publish the same version twice, so a version name that can be iterated is recommended. Run the following command, the config will first be linted and the local asset availability verified:

```
ppu build v1.0.0.0
```

##### 5. Publishing
Finally, we can publish our Application to the Polystream platform. Once you’ve retrieved your tenant id and token, run the publish command in your Application directory, it takes the version name specified in the last step as an argument:

```
ppu publish 1.0.0 --tenantId=<TENANT_ID> --tenantToken=<TENANT_TOKEN>
```

Congratulations! Presuming that everything went well, you should find your new Application in the Polystream dashboard, ready to be installed and streamed from an Agent.

## Updating a Polystream Application
Updating our Application is a very simple process, we repeat steps 2 and 3 from the prior section. So, first build a new version of your Application:

```
ppu build 2.0.0
```

Secondly, we need to publish the new version:

```
ppu publish 2.0.0 --tenantId=<TENANT_ID> --tenantToken=<TENANT_TOKEN>
```

## Usage

##### init [application] (--tenantId) (--tenantToken) | (-? | -h | --help)
Initialises a new .polystream directory in the current directory which contains an Application config json file.
- `[application]` The name of your application, this can be multi-value and will be converted to camelCase for the Application ID (e.g. Polystream App -> polystreamApp). This ID is also used to generate the Application config name (e.g. Polystream App -> polystreamApp_config.json).
- `(--tenantId)` If provided, this will store your tenant (client) ID as plaintext in the application config so that you don't have to manually provide it at the publish step.
- `(--tenantToken)` If provided, this will store your tenant (client) secret as plaintext in the application config so that you don't have to manually provide it at the publish step.
- `(-? | -h | --help)` Describes the command.

##### config (-e|--edit) (-s|--show) | (--architecture) (--directx) (--dllLocation) (--exe) (--workingDir) (--startUpArgs) | (-? | -h | --help)
Every Polystream Application requires a config.json, this tells the Agents how to install and run your Application. The config command generates a minimal config.json, which will at least be able to inject the necessary .Dlls for streaming and launch your Application, further modification may be necessary depending on your Application, the config is stored at .polystream/run_config.json
- (-e|--edit) Opens the config.json file in your default editor (Windows only).    
- (-s|--show) Prints the contents of the config.json to the terminal

**Note**: The edit and show flags *are mutually exclusive* with the following settings flags i.e. using either of these flags, ppu will ignore further flags.
- (--architecture) Sets the architecture your Application is designed for in the *config.json*, x64 or x86 are the only valid inputs, any other will be ignored.
- (--directx) Sets the version of DirectX your Application will use in the *config.json*, d9 or d11 are the only valid inputs, any other will be ignored.
- (--dllLocation) Sets the location in your Applications directory where Polystream .Dlls will be injected, these are necessary for your Application to stream.

**Note**: This command *is* able to update config.json values on the fly, but the DLL settings rely on --architecture and --directX, so these must also be provided to update the DLL location.
- (--exe) Points to the .exe file that Polystream will run when your Application is launched.
- (--workingDir) Points to the base line directory of your Application, this can be left blank if it is not different to where you are running the ppu.
- (--startUpArgs) Arguments to be run with your .exe when Polystream starts your Application.
- (-? | -h | --help) Describes the command.

##### lint | (-? | -h | --help)
Lints the run_config.json for the current application.
- (-? | -h | --help) Describes the command.

##### build [version] (--force) | (-? | -h | --help)
Compresses and packages your application in its current state ready to be shipped to Polystream. These packages are stored in .polystream/packages/
- [version] The version of your build, this can be either a single string or an int value.
- (--force) Builds your application without validating all the referenced assets are available.
- (-? | -h | --help) Describes the command.

##### publish [version] (--production) (--tenantId) (--tenantToken) (--force) | (-? | -h | --help)
Publishes a given build of your Application to Polystream.
- [version] Tells the ppu which built version of your Application to Publish.
- (--publish) Whether to publish your Application to Production, default is Development. Currently unimplemented.
- (--tenantId) Provides your tenant (client) ID, if this is not provided ppu will try to retrieve it from your application config.
- (--tenantToken) Provides your tenant (client) secret, if this is not provided ppu will try to retrieve it from your application config.
- (--force) Force publishes, PPU will not ask for confirmation.

## Errors and Debugging
The PPU does its best to provide useful error messages when something goes wrong, you can see these errors and what the PPU is trying to communicate to the user below. If those errors don’t immediately provide the user with a way to fix the problem, logs with stack traces are available in an initialised directory under `.polystream/output/... `

**(1) Generic error:** PPU reports that `Something went wrong.` This means that some unexpected exception was thrown. You will need to investigate the logs to get a full idea of what has happened here.

**(1001) Directory Initialisation error**: PPU reports that `Failed to initialise the current working directory as a Polystream Application.` This means that the PPU has thrown an `InitialiseDirectoryException`, which indicates that some failure has occurred while the PPU was creating your `.polystream` directory as part of the `init` command.

**(1002) Package Build error**: PPU reports that `Failed to initialise the current working directory as a Polystream Application.` This means that the PPU has thrown a `PackageBuildException`, which indicates that some failure has occurred while trying to compress your Application directory or that the PPU was unable to find your Application config JSON file. This is most likely to occur during the `build` command. 

**(1003) Argument error**: PPU reports that `Something went wrong trying to read your argument.` This means that PPU was unable to process one of your arguments or flags in some way.

**(1004) Run Config error**: PPU reports that `Something went wrong while trying to get your Run configuration.` This means that the PPU was unable to retrieve your run config (i.e. `config.json`) or else it was unable to generate or update this configuration while running the config command.

**(1005) Authentication error:** PPU reports that `Something went wrong while trying to authenticate your Polystream developers account.` This means one of several things, the PPU was unable to find your tenant id and token to use for authentication, it is likely that you haven’t provided this information as a flag or that it isn’t set in the `appsettings.json`. Secondly, the OAuth authentication request returned with a non-successful status code, or finally, some other exception was thrown while trying to authenticate. This is likely to be thrown while running the PPU `publish` command.  

**(1006) Polystream Cloud error**: PPU reports that `Something went wrong while trying to validate your run_config.json.` This means that the run_config.json failed to deserialize. The specific message should provide more details, or if required the log output will hold the full stack trace.

**(1007) Run Config Invalid Error**: PPU reports that `Something went wrong while trying to validate your run_config.json.` This means that there was an error whilst validating the `run_config.json` file. The specific message should provide more details, or if required the log output will hold the full stack trace.

**(1008) Run Asset Validation Error**: PPU reports that: 

```
The following validation errors have occurred:
- {Error description}.
```

This means that there was an error whilst validating that the package assets exist locally on the user machine. This exception can be thrown during the build phase. The specific message should provide more details, or if required the log output will hold the full stack trace.

**Firewall issues**: If you see the following error `Failed to authenticate your tenantId and tenantToken: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions` this is caused by your local Firewall rules. You just need to open up the necessary Port.
