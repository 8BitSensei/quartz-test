Related to the [[Shared responsibility model]]

In SaaS, you are essentially renting or using fully developed application services for example: Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software.

#### Common Scenarios
- Email and messaging
- Business productivity applications
- Finance and expense tracking
