Way to describe time-space complexity of algorithm based on **input size**

Commonly uses three notations Big O, Omega, and Theta

Big O provides the worst case scenario
Omega provides the best case scenario
Theta describes the average case scenario

While not always accurate, provides benefits over an experimental analysis, such as hardware differences, time restraints, or changes in performance based on input values
