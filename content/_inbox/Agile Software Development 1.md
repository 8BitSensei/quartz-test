Developed in the 90's in opposition to heavy methods such as 'waterfall'. Including methods such as rapid application development (RAD), unified process (UP), and dynamic systems development method (DSDM).

Agile was first put forward in 2001 with the Agile manifesto, it claims that the technique values:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

But, while the items on the right have value, the items on the left should hold greater value.

The manifesto goes onto layout 12 core principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for customer competitive advantage
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work on the project together daily
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give *them* the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done
6. Working software is the primary measure of progress
7. Agile processes promote sustainable development. We should be able to maintain a constant pace.
8. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
9. Simplicity, the art of maximising the work not done, is essential
10. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams
11. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts behaviour accordingly.
