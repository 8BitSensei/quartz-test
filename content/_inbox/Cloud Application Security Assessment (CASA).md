Built on industry recognised standards of the [[OWASP]]'s Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS).

The CASA requirements are used for all assessment tiers. They span across all assurance levels of theÂ [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/).

For an application to be CASA verified, the developer must pass all CASA requirements that are applicable to their application.

There are three tiers.

1 Developer Tested - Untested or verified
2 Developer Tested - Developer assesses with recommended tools and provides results to a lab.
2 Lab Tested - A Lab tests and validates app
3 Lab Tested - Lab will test and validate all CASA requirements.


#### Tier 2 Process
The Developer will scan their own application and provide the scan results and other evidence to an authorised assessor (the lab) for verification.

##### 1 Notification
Assessments are initiated by ADA partner companies (e.g. Google) and you will receive a notification
##### 2 Scan
Follow the guidance to scan your app, remediate any problems

#### 3 Submit
Create a CASA account and login, you will need to submit:
- Notification email
- Industry certs if any
- AST configuration file(s)
- AST scan results in plain text

#### 4 Finalise
Obtain a Letter of Validation (LOV) to continue with verification
