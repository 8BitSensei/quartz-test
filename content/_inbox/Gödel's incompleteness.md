Very easy to tell if a formula is well-formed in a formal system, simply reclusively break the formula down into it's base formulas

We don't know long a proof will be, it is unpredictable.

Much harder to tell if a well-formed formula (wff) is also a valid theorem

We only know something is a valid theorem if there exists a proof of it

But we cannot predict how long a proof will be, nor the length of its strings
