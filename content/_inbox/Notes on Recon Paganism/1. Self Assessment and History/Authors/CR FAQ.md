### [The CR FAQ](http://www.paganachd.com/faq/intermediate.html#upg) 2007

They define a body of 'lore' made up of, 'ancient' manuscripts, folklore from the celtic countries, and traditional tales, poems, and songs. They accept different levels of accuracy and 'authenticity', including the concept of primary, secondary, and tertiary sources.

**Primary** - But, they consider the MSS and folklore as primary sources. It's unclear what tme period they're trying to understand? 

> Human error and human bias is always a factor to bear in mind, even with primary sources. Part of utilizing any source is to understand the context in which the information was recorded, and to take into account any possible biases on the part of the recorder, whether that recorder was a Christian monk or someone’s great-grandmother. One of the ways we strive for accuracy is to compare all the different records of lore and practices, and through these comparisons a fuller, more accurate picture usually emerges.

I think this needs more unpacking, there ultimately isn't one true form, comparing only gets us to a generalised best fit. Which is fine. Also categorising those differences as errors or human bias seems weird. 

**Secondary** - the primary material in translation, along with what is written by those examining these documents, doing research and drawing conclusions.

**Tertiary** - CRs generally consider tertiary research unreliable. Tertiary research does not look at primary sources at all. It only looks at secondary sources of varying quality and draws conclusions from that material.

Language learning isn't neccesary but has obvious benefits and can help with ethical issues, sort of a way of giving back to the culture they're 'working' with.

> **UPG** = Unsubstantiated Personal Gnosis. This is a label used to identify information gained through meditation, intense flashes of intuition, visions, and other spiritual experiences.

> **SPG** (Shared Personal Gnosis) — indicating a mystical vision and belief shared by a number of people; preferably, one arrived at independently of one another and arising from people who are otherwise unconnected.

> **CG** (Confirmed Gnosis) — indicating that substantiating evidence for an incidence of UPG or SPG has later been found in the lore.


UPG is defined, apparently definesd in the  Ásatrú community in the 90s

They also define Shared Gnosis (SG) and Confirmed Gnosis (CG). For UPG that becomes popular or later becomes confirmed. Not sure the point in CG, at the point it's just knowledge, not gnosis.

> Instances of CG are also very important in that over time they help us learn to distinguish true _imbas_ from imagination.

There is the idea of true inspiration, true UPG, that can only be proved as true by it's ascension through to CG.

So we have, personal hypothesis, a common hypothesis, a verified hypothesis which is now included in the theory.

> UPG is never an end in and of itself; rather, it is the beginning of a journey, the beginning of the process of testing the information through both spiritual practice and academic research. ==UPG is only useful when the community also values humility and fact-checking==, and acknowledges that even the most experienced mystic can at times become deluded or make mistakes.

The value of UPG is dependent on humility and fact-checking, UPG is only valuable when it has the potential to become verified or verified against and be honest about what it is. But they go on that UPG can be included in spiritual practice, but with some rules, which they call **The Laws of UPG:**
1. **No UPG should contradict known facts** about the associated culture, and **no practices based only on UPG should stand as more than modern inventions**.
2.  If a belief or practice based on UPG does not contradict known facts, but **cannot be verified within the same body of knowledge, it remains a modern invention**.
3.  If an instance of UPG fits rule 2 and also fills a gap in known tradition, **it is probably worth pursuing further, through experimentation and research**, to see if it can become SPG or CG.
4.  If an instance of UPG that meets the second law is **arrived at by people who have had no real contact with each other, it remains modern but is Shared (SPG)**. This means the group just may be getting somewhere interesting.
5.  If an instance of UPG becomes SPG, and said **SPG is then incorporated into the practices of those outside of the groups who first experienced it, it becomes a modern tradition.**
6.  **There is no way for UPG to become ancient lore** unless it becomes generally accepted and then is kept mostly intact for at least 1,000 years.


So, we have UPG which may arise ex nihilo, pure inspiration.
If this UPG contradicts known facts in the lore, drop it.
If it does not contradict known facts but is unverifiable, this is a modern invention.
If multiple people arrive at the same UPG, this collection can be known as SPG.
It becoming SPG is an indicator that it is worth investigating to see whether it can become verified.
If this SPG becomes incorporated into the practices of those other than the generators of the UPG, this becomes a modern tradition.

T\[\] := {G, G, ... n} where T is the set of all true statements (G)
LR\[\] ⊆ T
UPG := inspiration
¬UPG -> (Contradicted by any member of LR)
(SPG := {UPG, UPG, ... n} but UPG <-> UPG, so SPG <-> UPG)
Attemt to prove UPG by investigating T so that UPG <-> T\[G\], adding G to the subset LR\[\]
We are always trying to prove that UPG <-> G so that we can add it our set of known G's

Changing UPG into SPG seems pointless, first SPG is not a statement to be tested as true or false, it is a set of statements, statements which must be identical therefore collapsing the whole thing into UPG <-> SPG. You can resort to a group of people to ease the work of verification against LR but a statement can only ever be true within itself.

---

They again stress that UPG must be seen to see if it fits into the already existing set of known true statements, the 'lore', here they refer to as a cultural matrix. Of course we should remember that we are not verifying anything against the *culture*, just *our understanding* of that culture, a set of known true statements.

>  It is vital to examine everything you learn before using it in ritual or bringing it to the community as anything other than your own UPG.

Good practice, verify and be sure of you're knowledges state before bringing it to the table.

How to find best fitting trends for gaps.

> Remember that all of us have to throw out lovely ideas from time to time because there’s contradictory evidence in the lore and traditions or because facts stand against it. In those cases, such insights may be useful in personal practice, but don’t have a place in CR as a whole.

Take heart that a proven false statement still teaches us about the contours of our goal. A false statement is a poorly worded true statement.

> Since the basic purpose of CR is to reconstruct what Celtic Pagan religions could have become in the modern age, we must, with great respect for the ancient and living traditions, adapt ancient spiritual practices to fit within modern society’s legal and ethical structures.

Big axiom there ^^^

(a) The goal of Reconstructionism is to *reconstruct* past religions as they *could be* had they survived to the modern age.
(b) Had past religions survived to the modern age, they *would have* fit within modern society's legal and ethical structures.

I don't think this should be the purpose of recon, those religions didn't survive to the modern day and I don't think we can gain much value out of making a '*what if*' scenario our whole premise. Now, I do think meditating on that *'what if'* can be a useful practice to think through how that religion would need to adapt to exist in the modern world. But, it's not the point.

The problem with this thinking is that their premise (a) is the axiom for their argument for why we should adopt modern law and ethics. Now I do want modern law and ethics but this means I need a different argument.

> it’s more dishonorable to break socially just laws of the country we live in than it would be for us to set aside those practices which are now illegal, ethically inappropriate, or impractical to the point of impossibility in a modern context.

(c) It is *dishonourable* to break modern, **just**, laws and ethics.
(d) It is *dishonourable* to put aside practices apparent in the body of lore.
(e) a is **less dishonourable** than b.

We should not attempt to bring certain concepts to the contemporary world by re-definign them, the example they use is Old Irish political terms such as túatha. They also state this would be offensive to living Cultures:

> It is also offensive to the living Celtic cultures to attempt to radically redefine what these terms and titles already mean, and as we are involved in the living Celtic cultures, it would not even occur to us to do something so offensive.

(f) It is **offensive** to a culture to attempt to **re-difine** historical terms
(g) Do not attempt to bring historical concepts into the modern day by re-defining terms due to point (f)

> It is our desire instead to interact with the spirits of the land, the ancestors and the Deities in a respectful way, and to coexist peacefully and constructively with our human neighbors, no matter their background or religion

> We encourage people to contemplate what is good and useful about early Celtic cultures. We all attempt to cultivate a personal and communal sense of Celtic virtues such as Truth, Honor, Justice, Loyalty, Courage, Community, Hospitality, Strength, and Gentleness and to implement these values in our modern lives in ways that work for us.

> Use broad as well as deep study, especially of closely-related cultures, to help form a working hypothesis of how the Celtic ancestors may have done something? Yes, sometimes.

They don't borrow or 'steal' cultural elements trying to fill in gaps, they study closely related cultures to understand what a possible best fit would be, i.e. look at culture before and after the time period with missing evidence, is there a broad trend? Look at neighbouring cultures do they follow similar trends?

They talk bout not 'impoting rituals or beliefs', only going as far a field as looking at Welsh or Gaulish evidence, perhaps Norse (why no Roman?) or wider indo-European trends.

> However, many CRs are fine on keeping the tradition simple, sticking with the practices we have, and not attempting to elaborate anything.

I think this is a valid point, if you *don't need* what ever *you think* you're missing, it's probably better not to try and do something at all. We also have to be aware that what we're looking for, may no have existed at all.

> CR was developed to provide an alternative to those “Celtic religions” that were really just putting knotwork on ways foreign to the Celtic cultures (namely Wicca, generic Neopaganism and “core shamanism”) and that were pillaging Celtic cultures for a few exotic bits to spice up an otherwise eclectic practice. Therefore, a key element of CR is the deliberate avoidance of mixing our practice with other cultural practices.

Interesting historical note

> If we must “fill in the gaps,” we would be more likely to use ideas from other Celtic cultures, or at least other Indo-European cultures, to help us develop something Celtic to fill the gap.

There's a (not unfair) assumption of simmilarity here. Are we really sure that a Gaulish culture would be closer to Irish than say Scandinavian? It works on a premise of nearness * ease of communication, the physically nearer the group the more likely they are to share simmilarities, this is multiplied when they share common language or have closely related languages. But I find this thinking can miss out that monolinguism is a modern experience, almost all peoples in history would speak multiple languages. It's not hard to imagine Gaulish peoples in the south being fluent in Latin or even Greek, then when we multiply this by time spent in contact with each other, we can end up at very different results.


> ... it is too easy for people to try to bring in things that are not only disharmonious with Celtic culture, but even for them to unknowingly try to unnecessarily replace things for which we already have working, Celtic examples.

They mention that some people when they can't find neccesary evidence closer to home they feel justified in looking further afield  to flesh out the system, the example given ia AfroDiasporic traditons. This is considered controversial, and different traditions have verying oppinions. 

> but even among those who look to wide-ranging sources there is still agreement that this is only for hints to how to do something in a Celtic way.

I get the point here but I don't like the wording, yes llooking to broader world religions and cultures can give us an *idea* for how something could of worked in another place when
