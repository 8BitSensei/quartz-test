**Reconstructionism** entails:

-   Reverence for the indigenous Roman deities and Mysteries.
-   A connection with the ancestors and the [Lares](http://www.novaroma.org/nr/Lar "Lar") and [Penates](http://www.novaroma.org/nr/Penates "Penates"). In a modern context, this means a concern for the importance of family, in its broadest sense.
-   A connection with the Roman past. We strive to be as historically (and mythologically) accurate as the state of the evidence allows. When gaps in the evidence, or the realities of modern life, make it necessary to create something new it should be:
    -   As consistent as possible with what we do know about the classical-era Romans and their legacy.
    -   Clearly presented as a recent innovation. We frown on attempts to advertise something modern and invented as ancient and historical in order to give it an authority (and marketability!) it does not deserve.
-   A balanced approach to understanding classical Roman religion which relies on both sound scholarship and poetic inspiration without mistaking one for the other.
-   Inclusiveness. While we have the Roman fascination with genealogy, we do not rely on genealogy or geography to determine who is Roman.
-   Respect for women.
-   A moral code which stresses truthfulness, honor, personal responsibility, and the other Roman virtues.
