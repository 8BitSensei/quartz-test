> There are no specific strictures of theological or spiritual belief that Reconstructionists _must_ adhere to because that would defeat the entire purpose. Instead, Reconstructionism is about grounding modern practice in ancient tradition, not locking ourselves in the dusty vault of history or yet another dogmatic subset of Heathenry. Reconstructionism is an investigatory philosophy, not a canonized orthodoxy.

> Reconstructionist Heathenry is based on the practice of investigating our history and traditions in a way that both provides a thorough understanding and attempts to minimize the influence of an individual’s personal biases.
