#### Uncovering the Effects of Cultural Background on the Reconstruction of Ancient Worldviews

Writes about the challenges intepreting the material when you come from a modern, urban, world and trying to shift perspectives for a more accurate recon.

The material begin slyly criticising (quite fairly) modern groups who maintain that there was some continuation of 'Old Religion' until this century. They also state that "some of the vestiges of the older heathen philosophy and way of life which lingered on for centuries afterwards in the more agrarian areas" which feels like an oversimplification.

They intend to present several methods to reveal alterations in thought which impede 'true' reconstruction of ancient world views, which is, enthusiastic to say the least!

Continues with criticisms of Wicca, the common issues reconstructionsists have. Conspiracy theory esque thinking and pick-a-mix matching aspects from cultures that feels unethical to say the least.

Just going to say here, because I get the feeling this paper is going that way. Over mixing is bad, it becomes a real issue with cultural appropriation and can't produce good results. Isolationism is also bad! Culture's in real life mixed with their neighbours and further a field trading partners! Cultural isolationism borders on essentialism, and ideas about what and who is a part of that.

He points out that in the 60's and 70's many groups started appearing that we would describe as reconstructionist, across Europe and North America. 

"All these reconstructive efforts focus themselves on a time frame between 500 CE to the point of conversion for each respective ethnic group because written documentation is available from that period of time and the archeological record is clear enough to establish the veracity of the written reports." Not so sure. But we do see an interesting point, that people are selecting time periods that have the most corroborating evidence, i.e. the best time periof is when literary and archaeological evidence corroborate each other, which for northern europe (most of his examples are) is around this period.

He lays out some points for how these movements were different from prior movements:

1. No attempt to recreate a pan-european paganism
2. Attempts to stay within research guidelines developed over the past century
3. A multi-disciplinary approach is utilised
4. There are serious attempts to recreate culture, politics, science, and art of the period to better understand the context of religious practice

^ Issue with this, we don't need to 'recreate' these elements, especially politics to understand them, we should understand them so as to improve are understanding of religion (often the two cannot be seperated), but I do not wish to recreate in the modern world ancient Greek politics.

They also add that modern mythologies, occult practices, and pseudo-science should be avoided, and when they do appear they should be dissected and discarded.

The author starts discussing that other Pagan movements have criticised Reconstructionists, but, only goes onto warn that they sometimes call reconstructionists "fundamentalists", "elitists", and "Nazis" (the latter no doubt specific to Ásatru). He doesn't actually attempt to level with or debate criticism, it just feels a bit childish tbh. "There are criticisms of reconstructionsim yes, they call me a big meanie".

They talk about how some people try to "fill-in the gaps" with "fantasies" and how this can be highly destructive, they offer up the concept of "safety in numbers". Most researchers will chuck out these fantasies and the movement as a whole will remain on track.

It's a little intense but I broadly agree, while I think that there are cases where we legitimiately cannot know the answer to are questions about ancient religion, and that if neccesary these "gaps" can be filled in, not with fantasies, but with best guesses built on comparison with neighbouring/related cultures and statistical analysis. I do think these fillers should be held by individuals or small organisations and not by the whole movement, that way it remains absolutely transparent about where these gaps in our knowledge are, and they should remain open to future evidence.

Of course, all this makes it seem lilke there are only a few gaps, it's almost all gaps!

They go on to discuss the nature of the literary evidence and how it's largely written by Christians (in the north)

> Where the difficulty comes in is knowing exactly how much of each individual writer’s documentation was based on selective observation, ie documenting only those things which would serve the writer’s intent while ignoring others which would not, and how much was either skewing of the facts, propagandistic phrasing, or blatant deception in service of the writer’s intent.

The author begins classifying Ásatrú by their intent:
- **Reconstructionists** - one who looks seriously at reconstructing the ancient way worldview not to understand history better but often to investigate the applicability of such a worldview in the 21st century. These often remain strictly focused on one of the ancient Germanic language stocks.
- **Revivalist** - one who worships the Æsir and Vanir and often the demi-gods of the ancient Germanic peoples, such as elves. The focus is generally on reviving the religion of Ásatrú the 21st century and regenerate it as a distinctly modern religion. This group of adherents is much less likely to stay within a single language stock, but rather tends to mix traditions from the entire Germanic realm.
- **Neo-Heathen** - Often these come to the heathen community through a new age religion such as wicca or through a spiritual persuasion such as neo-shamanism and are less likely to engage in reconstructionist research. Their research is usually focused on how Ásatrú and Germanic folk traditions can benefit the new age community at large.

^ A lot to unpack there.

The author does immit that these categories are more of a continuim.

The author goes onto criticse those who traditionally view Christianity as the enemy, because Heathens will tend to see what Christianity does and **just do the opposite**, which is bad practice.

They state:
> Many of the problems impeding the re-creation of the ancient preChristian germanic worldview is that the reconstruction is being handled by many who unknowingly espouse and maintain a Christian worldview both through their reactions to it and because the Christian worldview is essentially the foundation of all their mental processes at the levels of the conscious and the subcoscious.
