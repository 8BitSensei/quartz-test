### u/Selgowiros2, 2019, [A brief primer on Reconstruction: How to do it and innovate within its structure.](https://www.reddit.com/r/heathenry/comments/dit35c/a_brief_primer_on_reconstruction_how_to_do_it_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

They begin by defining what reconstructionism is, it is a methodology used to build a cohesive belief system centered around a specific ethno-cultural group located in a specific era of time (the length of the time span can vary). It is not attempting to recreate culture in a vacuum, it must accept that the cultures we study were influenced by foreign cultures or adapted over time while maintaining a persistent identity.

This author is immediately much more aware of  the plasticity of culture and critical of a strict ethno approach.  “This means that a big part of reconstruction of these different peoples is the willingness to adopt and adapt within their worldview.”

They express several stages a practitioner may go through, an early pre-reconstructionism stage which is highly eclectic, but then some may crave greater structure and a break from Protestant (or generalised Christian) over-culture, and so come to reconstructionism. The second phase is early in their reconstructionist career, “This is a period of excitement, enflamed passions and misdirection”, they find it fascinating and can believe that they are in some way returning to an ancient identity and worldview, “that they become a certain people”. Here they may inadvertently fall into a rigid understanding, which can cause frustration and stagnation in their practice, causing some to leave at this stage. They add that this rigid understanding can lead to self-isolation from wider sources and unnecessary hatred of non-related sources, they give the example of Roman vs German. There is a third and final phase, that they declare a healthy mindset that promotes religious growth, in this phase the practitioner understands reconstructionism as a way of building a baseline of understanding in which they can adapt or adopt what they want or need within the context or understanding of their reconstructive focus.

How to reconstruct and/or innovate in the reconstruction methodology:
Adopt the worldview of your cultural focus, meditate on how someone in that focus (e.g. a medieval Heathen) would think or react to certain scenarios? They give several examples, such as an uninvited guest showing up? What if you are wronged? How do you pray? This is a technique to gauge how well you understand the worldview, they recommend staying up to date on ‘worldview studies’, they don’t address non Norse scenarios where there is less textual material to reach this point.

Understand that these people were not static, adapting and adopting has and will continue to happen.

Identify a practice you need or desire e.g. how do you sanctify a shrine?

Exhaust primary sources looking for some kind of precedence, even if you don’t find any move to the next step

Use comparative studies, beginning with IE, then expanding out to non-IE, they add that this is not an excuse for appropriative behaviour.

Develop the practice and or belief.

In summary:
1.  Meditate on your understanding of the subject religion/worldview, ask yourself many questions about how they would react to day-to-day occurrences or religious questions.
2.  Appreciate that historical beliefs in your desired culture were dynamic and plastic
3.  Identify religious practice you desire
4.  Search for precedence of this practice in the primary sources for you culture
5.  Search for precedence of this practice using the comparative method across IE cultures
6.  Search for precedence of this practice using the comparative method across non-IE cultures
7.  Develop the practice/belief

What I quite like about this version is that it’s much more aware and nuanced in it’s understanding about the fluidity of culture and it’s awareness of cultural appropriation. It also focuses on “small scale religion”,  rather than in my original thoughts it doesn’t attempt to create a complete model of religion, rather you reconstruct a single idea at a time, in their example they look at meditation practices. 

I think we can incorporate this into our model, focusing on a single aspect of this at a time, I would like to have some way to incorporate this into a larger model of the religion somehow. The downside of their method is that you might never get a birds eye view of the religion, potentially missing aspects or structure; this reminds me of the multi-peak issue in genetic algorithms where you never reach the peak by just going step by step because the peak might be past two lower dips.
