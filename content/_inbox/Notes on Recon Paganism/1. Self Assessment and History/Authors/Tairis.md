They break it down into 6 significant sections:

Defining the what and who of their chosen ethno/linguistic group, she defines an ethinic group as a group of cultures that share similarities and common origins in language or material culture. 

Defining reconstructionists as those who look to historical beliefs (here exclusively pre-christian) of a specific culture and attempt to bring those practices into the modern world. She adds that they are not attempting to reconstruct those beliefs identically as they were due to its incompatibility with modern society and its legal system, also incomplete evidence. They begin with the assumption that Caesar’s comments on the Celts not writing down religious beliefs extends to Britain and Ireland, and this makes an exact reconstruction of Celtic beliefs impossible. They point out that in this sense ‘reconstructionism’ is a misnomer but that it was chosen to distinguish itself from the less academically rigorous and eclectic traditions.

They define three main sources of evidence: archaeology, historical (literature generally), and folklore/traditions (here she says that these can often be seen to preserve pagan elements of belief/practice). They state that other neopagan practices that don’t have a foundation in Celtic cultures are eschewed. There is a necessary layer of interpretation between the above mentioned sources and practice, this is where they introduce UPG (Unverified Personal Gnosis); this is used to fill in the gaps. Nonetheless, there is a preference for ‘hard evidence’, so if UPG contradicts the evidence it is to be thrown out.

They suggest that a ‘manual’ to this process may exist in the future.

They talk about how historically CRs tended to go for a pan-Celtic approach but now a culture-specific approach is preferred because in-spite of common origins of the Celts they were always distinct groups and many practices were culture specific, so mixing all this together cannot be historically accurate and thus not reconstructionist. They also suggest this follows trends in Celtic studies.

They go on to ethics, reconstructionism is not trying to perfectly recreate the past and in the same way we aren’t trying to live in roundhouses we aren’t trying to bring back illegal practices or ideas that mismatch with modern ethics. Importantly, they same that to some degree it is a reconstructionist practice to create the modern faith as if christianity hadn’t arrived (this assumes we might imagine what changes would of happened even if they never did), but Christianity does have a disproportionate effect on our modern ethics and we aren’t seeking to disregard that influence.

Epistemology/Sources, for some practices we have strong sources to go by such as in Gaul and Britain, the “issue” of Roman syncretism is touched on, some practitioners choose to re-create a historically attested syncretism Romano-Gaullish for example. While reconstructionism eschews eclecticism syncretism is considered valid when historically attested.

She addresses that there are poor contemporary sources but we can use later historical sources and traditions can be used to give us a broad image, the author notes that while some academics believe pre-christian practices continued others are conservative, the author falls on the former.

She addresses archaeology, saying that it can be used to see how pre-Christian cultures expressed themselves in ritual, this is to be compared against later practices to find consistencies, they use bonfires at festivals as an example.

Next she addresses historical sources, they allow us to examine myths to get an idea of how cultures perceived gods or incidental references to practices with pre-christian origins. They seem to be uncritical with this approach.

They mention onomastics can be used but nothing more.

They have a very uneven focus on the source types, folklore/practices is highest, then archaeology, then historical sources, then onomastics gets a bare mention.

They talk about how a practitioner has to be flexible in their beliefs as new evidence comes to light and replaces older ideas, they also say that academic sources are not the be all and end all and that some faith is required. They also expect that while new evidence could totally turn our understanding upside down  some core tenants tend to stay and that new research will inform them rather than remove them.

On CR verses Druidism they discuss how reconstructionists may choose to pursue the religion of lay people, and since much of the evidence they use is based on folklore the religion reconstructed will lean more to the lower end of the socio-economic ladder, rather than elite knowledge and perspective. They touch on how a practitioner may choose to focus on the spiritual ‘path’ of a poet, or warrior for example, further refining the choice of time period to occupation as well.

---

1.  Identify a desired culture    
2.  Identify a time period and potentially an occupation
3.  Assess sources, Folklore, Archaeology, and Historical
4.  When assessing post-Christian sources look for evidence of consistency with the pre-christian evidence before pulling upon it
5.  Interpret this evidence to construct a model of the religion
6.  Any gaps may be filled with UPG
7.  Integrate this model into the modern world so that no laws or ethical boundaries are broken
8.  Practice the religion
9.  Be prepared for new evidence to modify this model
