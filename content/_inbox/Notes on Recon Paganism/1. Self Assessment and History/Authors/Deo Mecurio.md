### [A CELTIC RECONSTRUCTIONISM](http://www.deomercurio.be/en/celtarum.html)

They begin by suggesting that those resistant to Roman syncretism will want to focus on a pre-Roman Gaulish tadition, but adds that this does not rule out significant links with the Hellenized and Etruscan worlds. They state that a casuality of this approach being able to specify into a specific tribal group, and creating a somewhat artificial synthesis of Celtic religion. This is likely due to the lack of sources in the pre-Roman period. 

There is an implicit point here. That It's better to focus on a time-period where we can produce more accurate results (Romano-Gaulish) than it is to focus on a less well understood period (Pre-Roman Gaul), which would neccesistate an artificial synthesis of sources, for ideological purposes (resistance to syncretism). Which either way does not exclude already strong links (read syncretism) with the Hellenised world under a more stable situation.

They list some of the earliest material evidence of celtic religion, particularly focus on symbolism and imagery. They then discuss certain pre-roman sanctuaries, stressing again that some were already semi-Hellenised. They list some of the common points we can deduce about the use of religious space from these sanctuaries common to both North and South Gaul.

They move on to textual sources. Discussing the evidence of Druids in pre-Roman ethnographic texts. Pointing out that after the conquest and atempts at supression Druids seem to have remained if only in a diminished form.

They mention numinastics, in that they can present us with another source of religious imagery.

We then move into a section where the author takes the full collection of evidence and categorises it by time period, here Julio-Claudian (27 BC - 68 AD). The reasoning being  "for that was a time when most Gauls still preserved **their** Celtic culture largely intact under Roman or Romanized masters". 

They go into how the evidence of syncretism a this early period (they characterise it as a first wave) was characterised by particularly 'jarring juxtapositions of Roman and Gaulish elements'. They then discuss several important monument such as the Column of the Parisian Boatmen.

This last section is particularly interesting. You get the idea, and a common idea in reconstructionism, that pre-Roman, independent Gaulish culture, and its religion *is better*, is, in a sense, *truer*. This is a common stance, if not explicit, that (obviously) colonialisation by a foreign state is bad, thus influence (religious or otherwise) from that foreign state is bad, so religion and culture before that influence is better. 

It can also get into ideas of cultural essentialism, that there is, at some point in the past a True Celtic religion, a True Gaulish Religion, that may well be ultimately lost but with a carefully constructed patchwork of evidence, can be intuited in some way.

What is more common is the idea that, any pre-conquest religion or culture is equally true and good, un-blemished by violent colonialism, not that religion had been becoming equally less true since some unspecified point in the past.

While, I don't disagree that what the Romans did was evil, and that independence from foreign millitary occupation is good. I don't think we should forget, or even dismiss the colonised. A colonised Gaul is still a Gaul, and equally so as a pre-Roman Gaul as long as they choose to remain a Gaul. We should also remember that so much of Romano-Celtic culture, including evidnce we might use such as syncretism or temple structures, are the work of the colonised. The colonised, who are actively and with agency trying to shape their world, and with all likelihood more than aware of their traditons.

I could ramble on longer but I don't know enough about post-colonial theory to make a valid point.

Either way, we see some interesting points about how they select the time period of reconstructionsim and bring in evidence from after or later.

a) Pre-colonial religion is better but poorly documented
b) Post-colonial religion is better documented and will provide a more accurate result
c) Post-colonial religion degrades over time from it's pre-colonial state
d) Therefore, the best period is the one which has the highest amount of evidence and the least degredation from a pre-colonial state.
e) The author identifies this period as the Julio-Claudian period

The author in conclusion, summarises everything we would need to abandon to reconstruct a pre-roman religion (most divinites, jupiter columns, mythology and philosophy, temples, celebrations, etc) vas what we would gain (a higher status position of Druids). They conclude that what is to gain from post-Roman syncretism, the sheer amount of available evidence of authentic practice,  is worth **it**. But that they recognise that emphasising the strictly Celtic heritage is a cherished, and respected desire. 

The conclusion they draw maps quite well to my conclusions from their writing. There is a waying off between pre-Roman and post-Roman greater evidence vs nebulus pre-fall paradise. I joke, but the pre-Roman does in some way get treated as a pre-fall paradise, something we ultimately strive for, but can never truly reach.

In summary:

1. Identify a historical culture or tradition
2. Select a time period of interest
3. If that time period has poor evidence, it's better to push the boundary towards a period that does have evidence thant to poorly reconstruct you're originally desired period
4. Be aware that the borders of a culture or tradition are porous, so be aware of neighbours and historic influence
5. Synthesise the evidence from this period, looking at archaeological material, particularly cult centres, literature, and numinastics.
6. When we're looking at a somewaht broad area, we can try to draw out informative commonailities across that area.
