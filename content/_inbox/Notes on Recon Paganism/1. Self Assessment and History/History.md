Reaction against more ecclectic traditionins such as wiccanism

People increasingly losing faith that the intellectual historic basis of these traditions was strong enough and they didn't actually have a good idea about historic paganism, i.e. the murray hypothesis was toss.

Does this correlate with Wiccans increasingly accepting their faith as a modern eclectic faith and still justified? Maybe we can think of it as a small schism in the pagan world as scholarship tearing down the historical basis for Wiccanism becomes more available?
