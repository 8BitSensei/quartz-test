# Notes
---

- We should assemble all the current methodologies, eclectic, recon, comparative, 
- Should we be comparing ourselves and looking for lessons from movements that try to revive other "extinct" aspects of culture such as language? Maybe also re-enactors or archaeological artists. Modern Sanskrit, Modern Latin, 
- Where does belief and philosophy sit? Should we follow our understanding of the past in that practice was strict while belief was more open, if we do, is there any point in reconstructing ancient beliefs alongside practices, why not ;et people believe what they want?
- How do we deal with the ethics of appropriation when borrowing?
- We should recognise that our tradition of attempting to recreate paganism, academically and spiritually came out of a Christian world, e.g. protestant reformation, development of the "secular"
- How do we achieve legitimacy / authenticity? and for who?
- Am I right to conflate legitimacy and authenticity?
- A lot of evidence of pre-christian religion shows it was highly pragmatic, is this at ends with highly romantic modern pagan goals? But this is just as common with popular Catholicism and that lives alongside high minded soul searching, so does raising an altar to the Genii of the latrine and neoplatonism ([https://twitter.com/DrFrancisYoung/status/1295617307864162304](https://twitter.com/DrFrancisYoung/status/1295617307864162304))

# Methodology generalised
---

### Tairis
1.  Identify a desired culture    
2.  Identify a time period and potentially an occupation
3.  Assess sources, Folklore, Archaeology, and Historical
4.  When assessing post-Christian sources look for evidence of consistency with the pre-christian evidence before pulling upon it
5.  Interpret this evidence to construct a model of the religion
6.  Any gaps may be filled with UPG
7.  Integrate this model into the modern world so that no laws or ethical boundaries are broken
8.  Practice the religion
9.  Be prepared for new evidence to modify this model

### Selgowiros
1.  Meditate on your understanding of the subject religion/worldview, ask yourself many questions about how they would react to day-to-day occurrences or religious questions.
2.  Appreciate that historical beliefs in your desired culture were dynamic and plastic
3.  Identify religious practice you desire
4.  Search for precedence of this practice in the primary sources for you culture
5.  Search for precedence of this practice using the comparative method across IE cultures
6.  Search for precedence of this practice using the comparative method across non-IE cultures
7.  Develop the practice/belief

### Deo Mecurio
1. Identify a historical culture or tradition
2. Select a time period of interest
3. If that time period has poor evidence, it's better to push the boundary towards a period that does have evidence thant to poorly reconstruct you're originally desired period
4. Be aware that the borders of a culture or tradition are porous, so be aware of neighbours and historic influence
5. Synthesise the evidence from this period, looking at archaeological material, particularly cult centres, literature, and numinastics.
6. When we're looking at a somewaht broad area, we can try to draw out informative commonailities across that area.
