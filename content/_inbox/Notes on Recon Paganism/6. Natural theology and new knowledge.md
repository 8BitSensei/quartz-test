#### Natural theology and new knowledge
---

- Is there anything we can learn about the gods naturally on our own? i.e. If there is a god of the sea, and the sea is a fundamental part of the god can I learn about this god from studying and experiencing the sea? Without historical sources. We can think of this as a flip of traditional idea of natural law, where pre-christians without scripture could still come to a righteous life and understanding of god by studying nature, the ability to learn this is innate in the human soul. For us the "scripture" is in the past and often now lost, but we can use this idea of natural law to achieve knowledge of the gods without it.
- The role of personal Gnosis, an innate feature of any living religion but what about when it contradicts other ideas, theory, or evidence? This is when splinters occur, is that fine?
