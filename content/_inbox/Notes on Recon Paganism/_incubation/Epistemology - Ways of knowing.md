- "Stratigraphy" of knowledge, archaeology -> written sources -> interpretation -> expansion

- That which we know we know, that which we don't know we know, that wich we know we don't know, that which we don't know we don't know

- Blur the lines between material and written evidence, writing is material

- All sources are valid and equal for their time and place

- But this don't deny us a stratigraphic interpretation, interpret archaeology first, written sources ontop (maybe you could argue other orders), let those sources speak for themselves before we interpret them through are own theories and current cultures.

- This produces an ontological "nesting doll" begining with what the earth itself gives us (archaeology), the internal selves (written sources) of individuals in the past - as best you can ever see into the internality of others through the medium of writing, and onwards into our own societies internal structures (theoretical frameworks) and ultimately our own internal selves (our own interpretation).

- I think there is a neccesity for the individual to maintain a distance from dominant theoretical frameworks, we should be able to use and analyse these frameworks as tools of analysis themselves before coming to our own oppinions.

Charlie, stop jumping in with your own ideas! We need to survey existing theory first.
