Break down the boundaries between Christian and Pagan, [[Petts D (2011) Pagan and Christian, Religious Change in Early Medieval Europe]] is very good for this. Focusing on the primacy of ritual as a cultural reptoire which can cross boundaries of religious identity.

The bounaries of religious and ethnic identiyt are diverse through history, we need to be very careful when using traditional terms to identify religious traditions, they are often also considered cultural or ethnic identities as well as religious. I do not want reconstructionsim to become 'Folkish', a trend which puts ethnicity above the Gods, and in many pagan scholarly circles is refuted veamently.

Though we shouldn't forget that these issues are not new, look at the relationship between ancient Jews and Christians, the issues defining those boundaries.
