There is a bigger question about ethics in recon, where do we get our ethical teaching from? Contempory ethics? Or do we look back at Pagan authors to see how they treated the issue?

I really don't like the idea of relying on classical authors for our ethical teachings, god(s), just imagine having to be in a room with Aristotle. I'm sure a lot of authors have written on how we can maintain our modern ethics and ideals of justice and equality while learning from our forebears.

We should lay down some hard ethical rules when practicing reconstructionism:
1. Radical equaility, all humans are equals and all aspects of our humanity shall be treated equaly, are individual needs, cultures, and histories.
2. The dead, the living, and those who will live are equals
3. Intelectual honesty, we must be brutaly honest with ourselves about are intelectual endeavours, where they come from and the impact they have.
4. We shall fight the use of our works in anyway that break the prior points
