## Landscape Archaeology, Paganism, and the Interpretation of Megaliths
---

> Despite thetensions between archaeologists and Pagans over access to and propercustodianship of megalithic architectural sites in Britain and elsewhere,opportunities exist for fruitful intellectual and social exchange betweenthe two vocations.

> Conversely,many Pagans (particularly but not exclusively reconstructionists) andmost archaeologists are interested in learning about past cultural reali-ties using material evidence. Despite their differences, then, there is anopportunity for rapprochement between these two disparate ways ofinterpreting built environments.

> For Pagans hailing from recon-structionist traditions, however, empirically grounded archaeologicalperspectives that aim to understand past peoples’ use of landscape andspace—rather than agnostic or even nihilistic perspectives that deny thatsuch accounts are valid—are frequently seen as desirable.

> In conversations and interviews with Pagans from various tradi-tions, we have been impressed both with the respect that many Pagansshow for megalithic architecture and for archaeological knowledge in general. While recognizing the value of “unverived personal gnosis” (UPG) as a means of personal spiritual insight into historical or archae-ological material, many of our conversation partners have equallyemphasized the role of evidence-based research. Virtually all archae-ologists, likewise, recognize the value of intuition as a source of ideasand hypotheses; if they then insist on evidence (as most do), it is in noway dismissive of intuition, but simply to insist that shared knowledge of prehistoric reality requires shared standards of validation.

Emphasis on that "hared knowledge of prehistoric reality requires shared standards of validation." but this does not dismiss UPG.

> Inevitably, some Pagans (and indeed, some non-Pagans) disagree ideo-logically with the aims of archaeology. After the excavation of “Sea-henge,” at Holme-next-to-the-sea (a feature archaeologists classifyas a timber circle), an outcry arose over the purportedly disrespectfulmanner in which the land was treated, as many Pagans felt that thearea ought to have been left as it was.

> HJ: “Archaeologists and academics are looking for a definitive truth,
whilst what we’re looking for are. usable bits, and relevant bits, and per-
sonal bits, and taste…It’s more of an overview than this endless search tobe the one that finds the truth. WE don’t need to be correct every time we talk, we don’t need the people we’re talking to be correct, because we’re re-using, not re-finding.

I disagree with this informant, while we are re-using that's all the more reason to strive to be accurate. I do agree that we have different goals, we want to 'use' (I don't like that word) the past, but I want to use an accurate undertsanding of the past, because if you're not forming ana ccurate idea you're not actually using the past, just your own ideas.

The material remains of our past are the primary mediators of knowledge about religious tradition, pagans more than most need to see this and in accepting agency of the dead and the gods **respect** the past. The first step is striving for accuracy.

> By far the most significant work on the interaction of Pagans and archaeologists has been the work of the Pagan archaeologists JennyBlain and Robert Wallis. Much of their work has focused on the extremetension over the contested access to sites such as Stonehenge amongBritish Paganism, a subject beyond the scope of this paper.

> Her anger, however, is rooted inthe personal attachment she feels to the particular culture being inaccu-rately portrayed, and over the course of her article she strives to identifyand unpack the reasons that her reaction was so immediately and vis-cerally negative.

> However, in a notable demonstration of the gap that issometimes present between the requirements for authenticity in archae-ological interpretation and the requirements for authenticity in Paganinterpretation, she tellingly admits that “the most astounding feature of the article, for me, is that…the account remains devoid of any grounding in culture, history, work, change, movement or discovery, or, most specifically, community.” While Pagan and archaeological interpreta-tions are not always mutually exclusive, it is clear that at times they arecompiled with regard to very different sets of criteria.

Differences between concepts of authenticity between pagan and archaeological communities.

> “Current trends in so-called post-processual archaeology—much influenced by postmodern resisance to metanarrative and hegemony—have promoted plurality ininterpretation.... as archaeology is increasingly required to make itselfrelevant to contemporary society, so contemporary folkloric practicesand earlier understandings vis-à-vis archaeological remains are onceagain receiving attention.”

> Wallis and Blain note that, though they are archaeologists, they are also Pagans, and as such “engage with sacred space and find ourselves involved not only in disseminating information, but in the construc-tion of stories around site, landscape and spirits”.

> Reconstruction does not always serve scientific purposes, however, and parallels can be seen in contemporary Pagan practice. For instance, Stone City near San Fran-cisco has erected a henge for the use of Pagans otherwise geographicallydistant from European megaliths.

The methodological approaches between Archaeologists and Pagans can often overlap, for example phenomenology. 

> In regards to his approach to a hypothetical study of Stonehenge, Christopher Tilley explained that he would “try to buildup an intimate knowledge of the landscape-setting through walkingfrom one place to another, looking at views, the intervisibility between features…”

This isn't signifficantly different to a Pagan reconstructing historical experiences, especially ritual and the experience of sacred space. Where archaeological criticisms of this kinf of phenomenology point out that the conclusions from this approach are often unverifiable Paganism has the concept of UPG, a conceptual space that allows unverified interpretations which is honest about there un-verifiability but expresses it's validity and importance to the individual practicioner.

There are some examples of where Paganism has been vaildly in the wrong, ley lines or sea henge. And some cases where archaeology often needs to be checked, treatment of the dead and sacred material in museums. At it's best I think Paganism and Archaeology could be co-dependent and perform checks and balances on each other.

> While many Pagans wish to be able to connect with the beliefs and rituals of their predecessors through situat-ing themselves in the same environment, archaeologists want to under-stand the meaning behind such beliefs and rituals, and to comprehend the relationship between the society and the landscape. Additionally, the specific details of prehistoric life are not necessarily as important to many Pagans as they are in the archaeological community. Such adivergence is also apparent in the social composition of both commu-nities—while Pagans are inclusive and welcoming to a wide range ofbeliefs, archaeologists are more exclusive, truly opening their ranks onlyto those who share their academic credentials and professional training.

I'd contest that for us to connect to those beliefs it is neccesary to understand them, and to have a fuller understanding you need to situate in it's context.

### Coming Home to Paganism: Theory of Religious Conversion or a Theological Principle?

> The denying or at least sceptical attitude of Pagans towards New Age ideology5 and the movement as a whole reflects the idea that a religion should have its sources in tradition. For many Pagans the New Age is stripped of tradition, and has no roots, either in history or in a particular cultural background

> To sum up the arguments of followers: in Paganism, the focus is almost always on the historical times, with some reference to the present. New Age or other New Spirituality movements are about going global with one’s spirituality, unifying beliefs and practices, joining them in the pursuit of world understanding and reaching new levels of spiritual development. Contemporary Paganism in such an “ethnic” form is rather about the local than the global, and also embraces cultural diversity that should be maintained.

The concept of prioritising the 'local' is a massive trend in contemporary paganism, and it's not unique to paganism, a focus on organic food, low food miles, local business etc but the local can be taken too far, especially when the 'local' is not your actual 'local', but your idea of what your 'local' should be. Who should be local.
