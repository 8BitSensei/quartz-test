#### Relationship to later sources and traditions

- super/preternatural / spirit beings from the christian era? Fairies?
- What about gods only known from the Christian era? There is no pagan evidence of Dagda, but even so, Christians considered him a real god?
- How do we interact with post-pagan traditions?
- In between the previous two and the next, do we distinguish between pulling forward vs pulling back ideas? I.e. pulling back a medieval concept into our model of pre-christian religion vs bringing forth medieval ideas into our modern religious model built on our model of pre-christian religion.
