#### Integration to modern customs and culture
---

- What do we do with Christian or Christian produced culture, myths about saints, folk practices? I believe our philosophy should allow space for these, we should be able to worship YHW as well as Iupiter
- What is the role of aesthetics, this is related to concepts of projected legitimacy and integration.
- How do we feel about modern developments changes?
- Without these modern changes how can we have a living religion? Rather than just a museum piece? 
- What do we do with historical elements that are no longer ethical? Homophobia, sexism?
