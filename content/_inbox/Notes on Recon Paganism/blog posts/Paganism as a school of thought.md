Paganism has been defined in more ways than I can count, modern definitions tend to exist on a scale which at its narrowest, refers to a set of Religions largely developed in Europe and America in the 20th Century, and on the other end, a type of world religion which is polytheistic, nature focused, and incorporating most 'traditional' religions of the world.

York defined Paganism as a religion which utilises five specific criteria, (1) a number of both male and female gods, (2) magical practice, (3) emphasis on ritual efficacy, (4) corpospirituality, and (5) an understanding of gods and humans as codependent and related.[^1] York's work has been widely criticised, not least for its colonial attitude. Strmiska described Paganism as a movement "dedicated to reviving the polytheistic, nature-worshipping pagan religions of pre-Christian Europe and adapting them for the use of people in modern societies."[^2] It has also been characterised as a single religion, of which groups like Wicca, Druidry, and Heathenry are denominations.[^3]

There is however a consensus that the term originates in the fourth to fifth centuries, primarily in the Latin West as a pejorative term for adherents to traditional religion.

> The adoption of paganus by the Latin Christians as an all-embracing, pejorative term for polytheists represents an unforeseen and singularly long-lasting victory, within a religious group, of a word of Latin slang originally devoid of religious meaning. The evolution occurred only in the Latin west, and in connection with the Latin church.

Though whether the term originates as a term referring to rural peoples in their slowness to adopt Christianity, or as military jargon for a civilian in opposition to the military imagery of the early Church, e.g. the militites 'soldiers of Christ'[^4], is less certain. We do know that one of the earliest and most influential uses of the term in a way we would recognise today was St. Augustine's De Civitate Dei Contra Paganos. Dedicated to the critique of traditional Roman Religion, it was read across Europe in the Early Medieval period, which along with Isidore's Etymologiae were hugely influential in forming early Ideas of Paganism. Other terms that we recognise today would emerge around the same time, Gentile in late antiquity[^5], and Heathen of less certain origin, both with a near identical use to Pagan.

Back in the modern world, one of the undercurrents that I keep coming across in my studies is this kind of back-and-forth 'boundary setting' as Dr Jefferson Calico[^6] puts it, where people have been debating the meaning of Paganism versus the meaning of Polytheism. The core criticisms from those who reject the term Paganism seem to be twofold; first, the idea of Paganism, at least in the popular imagination is dominated by Wiccans, being one of the longest running traditions. Which, of course can be difficult for non-Wiccans who are often mistaken for Wiccans, especially to those who have very real criticisms of the tradition. Secondly, as Reddit user [u/Nocodeyv](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nocodeyv/), a self-identified 'Mesoptamian Polytheist' puts it[^7]

> I avoid using the word pagan for myself because it is historically inaccurate, and would be culturally disingenuous for me to label myself as such.
>
> The word pagan developed out of Christian ideology between the 2nd and 8th centuries CE, as a pejorative term for anyone who practiced a faith other than Judaism, Christianity, or Islam.
>
> The word polytheist also comes from a pejorative term—first used by Philo of Alexandria—the difference, however, is that polytheist describes the actual practices of an acolyte: the belief in many deities.
>
> I choose, therefore, to use the term polytheist instead of pagan, because I refuse to define myself by what I don't believe in, as would be the case if I accepted the label of pagan.

I've been mulling these ideas over while I work on another essay, a history and summary of Reconstructionist thought thus far, and, I've been wondering how we can think about these terms in a way that both resolves, or gets around valid grievances and is accurate to what Paganism really represents today. What if we discussed Paganism not as a religion or even a set of religions, but as a School of thought, or more accurately a School of Enquiry. One that looks back at the Religions that Late Antique and Medieval authors labeled as Pagan, and not only asks 'What, and why did they do what they did?', a question which has been investigated since the early Church authors I mention above, but goes on to ask, 'How did they do what they did?', and more importantly **'How do we do what they did?'**.

Let’s break all that down a bit. What exactly is a 'school of thought'? A school of thought is generally understood to be a tradition of thinkers, who all share some perspective, or whose opinions all share characteristics. That doesn't really cut it, one thing Pagans almost always fail to share in common is opinion. There are of course traditions where there is more in common, Reconstructionism for example could be considered a valid School of Thought, but not Paganism. A concept that could work here is that of a 'Field', or 'Discipline'. Participants in a discipline don't ever have to share opinions, but what they do share in common is the focus of their study and work. A Discipline also has seemingly endless sub-fields and methodologies, allowing it's participants to explore different ideas and paths, all in the service and practice of a single subject of enquiry. Artists, study art, and do art, Engineers, study engineering, and engineer, Pagans study Paganism and do Paganism.

What do we mean by 'doing'? Well, I mean exactly what I mean. Religion is a lot of things, it can be an ideology, a set of beliefs, moral guidelines, a set of rituals, but above all it is something that is done. I'm not going to spend time trying to define what we mean by Religion here, but I think it's enough to to accept that Religion, especially what we understand as Pagan Religion, centers around acts, especially that of cultus. Cicero understood religio, the origin of our modern word, as such:

> the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods.
>
> -- Cicero, De natura deorum 2.8.

Now I don't mean to be reductionist in our thinking about what Religion is, but I think it's enough to express my thinking, and leads us to the key point here. What separates a modern Pagan from any one else interested in and studying Pagan religion is that the Pagan seeks to do it. This of course, comes with a whole host of problems and questions to answer which go beyond the scope of this essay.

So, let's break down our proposed understanding of Paganism:

1.  Pagan is a label used by late antique and medieval scholars to refer to the religion of non-Christians in Europe, North Africa, and the Near East.
    
2.  Paganism is a discipline which seeks to understand Pagan Religions and practice those Religions in the modern world.
    
3.  This tradition becomes the modern discipline of Paganism when practitioners first attempt to enact those Religions which they study.
    
4.  This discipline derives from a tradition of thought in Medieval Europe which investigates Pagan Religions.
    
5.  Paganism is thus not a religion, but a discipline which has given rise to multiple Religious traditions over the past century or so.
    

I think this atleast resolves some tensions around Pagan and Polytheist labels. Here, most Pagans are Polytheists but not all Polytheists are Pagans, it also can't be used to refer to any specific Religion, just the tradition which allowed that Religion to develop and gave it its impetus. It also means we aren’t using Pagan as a Religious identity, just acknowledging the roots of our modern thought. This also resolves an issue I have with most prior definitions of Paganism, I don't agree with attempts to define Paganism by their shared, superficial characteristics. Modern Paganism is incredibly diverse and while there are often common concerns, such as ecological leanings, these are not intrinsic to what makes them Pagan. What makes them all Pagan is the shared impetus of "How do we do what they did?"

The idea really needs a great deal more development, and I'm not totally convinced by it myself. There are many questions that I've left open which I could investigate; Where do the first Pagan practitioners appear? What conditions led to it? What are the ethical ramifications of being derived from earlier thinkers who used Pagan as a derogatory term? Is the previous point an untenable assumption? Most of these questions have already been answered in other publications, and I'm comfortable to leave this idea here.
