#paganism 

Boyce has an odd idea of what Paganism is to her, at least odd to me. She draws heavily on Ken's European Paganism.

She uses a very ritual centric definition.

She uses the rural explanation of Paganism.

Sacrifice is made to gods / spirits

Paganism has many gods.

Animism.

Pan-theism <-> 'Select' animism

She think's Christianity created the non-animistic view

She seems Wicca parallel but definitely not Wicca, she challenges the idea that pagans worship nature by disrupting the border between those two things.


She thinks saints are extensions of earlier gods... don't think so. Emotional extensions though? Maybe?
