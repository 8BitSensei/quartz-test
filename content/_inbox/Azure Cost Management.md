Azure Cost Management is a service available as a GUI tool in the Azure Portal which allows you to check resource costs, create alerts based on resource spend, and create budgets that can be used to automate management of resources.

### Cost Analysis
Cost Analysis is a subset of Cost Management which provides a quick visual of your Azure costs across billing cycles, regions, resources and so on.

### Cost Alerts
A location to quickly check on your alerts in Cost Management, such as:
- **Budget alerts**: notify you when spending, based on usage or cost, reaches or exceeds the amount defined in the alert condition of the budget
- **Credit alerts**: notify you when your Azure credit monetary commitments are consumed. Monetary commitments are for organizations with Enterprise Agreements (EAs)
- **Department spending quota alerts**: notify you when department spending reaches a fixed threshold of the quota
