#History 

> The idea that each age is unique and different is called *Historicism* (from the German *Historismus*), and has been very popular among writers of all hues and tendencies since the nineteenth century. Historicists emphasised this idea that time changed society; that as [[John Tosh]] writes in *The Pursuit of History* (2nd edn, 1991), 'each age is a unique manifestation of the human spirit, with its own culture and values'. He adds: '**For one age to understand another, there must be a recognition that the passage of time has profoundly altered both the condition of life and the mentality of men and women**'. This succinct statement seems to stand as the ultimate warning against 'present-mindedness', or anachronism. However, it also represents a secularisation of history, and a substantive shift from the providential ideas which dominated the Middle Ages, wherein history (in this sense human development) was the expression of God's (unchanging) will on earth.
