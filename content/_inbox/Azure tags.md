Tags are just another way to organise resources in Azure, but are useful for providing extra information and metadata about your resources.

You can add, modify, or delete resource tags through Windows PowerShell, the Azure CLI, Azure Resource Manager templates, the REST API, or the Azure portal. You can also enforce tagging conventions through Azure Policy, tags are also no inherited at all.
