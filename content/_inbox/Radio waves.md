Radio waves are *a type of [[Electromagnetic radiation]]* with the longest wavelengths in the spectrum. 

Typically it has frequencies of 300 GHz and below.

Radio waves are generated by charged particles undergoing acceleration, such as time varied electronic currents. Radio waves can be naturally occurring, emitted by lighting for example.
