Conditional Access is an authentication toll used by [[Microsoft Entra ID]] to make decisions about allowing, or prompted users for authentication, or even blocking sign-in attempts based on a series of '*signals*' about the user attempting to sign on. These signals can be about the users identity, location, device.

This helps prevent security failures for a company while making sign-on simple and easy for regular employees

The docs break this down into three steps **Signal, Decision, and Enforcement**
