A Logarithm is a function to find out how many times we have to multiply a base number to achieve the value provided, e.g. `log2(8) = 3` as `2 \* 2 \* 2 = 8`, it tells us the exponent to use with a given base number to achieve an exponent.

One thing to bear in mind is that in Computer Science, a logarithm is usually base 2 by default, as this is the most common base we will be using. But, this is not always the case, so watch out!
##### Tips
You can convert a log to a different base in the following way:
`logx(b) = logy(b) / logy(x)`. So, `log4(23) = log2(23) / log2(4) = 1.36172783602 / 0.60205999132 = 2.26178097806`
