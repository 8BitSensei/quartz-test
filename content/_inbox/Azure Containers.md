#### Azure Container Instances
Fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure. Container Instances are [[Platform as a service]] (PaaS), allowing you to upload your containers and then the service will run the containers for you, similar to how a VM is managed.

#### Azure Container Apps
Similar to Container Instances, they allow you to get running right away, also a PaaS offering. Extra benefits include the ability to incorporate load balancing and scaling, allowing you to be more elastic in your design.
