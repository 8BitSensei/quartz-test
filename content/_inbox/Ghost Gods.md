### Ghost Gods, or the 'after' life of accidental Gods

How hypothetical deities reconstructed from partial evidence, or misidentified can go onto to become 'ghost gods', by analogy with 'ghost words'.

'Ghost words', are a term used for entries in dictionaries which originates in some kind of linguistic or editorial error, despite it never have being used. None the less, these words may go on to enter into popular language and become real words.

Two examples I can think of:

Brigit,
Danu

are there any other examples from other parts of the world?
