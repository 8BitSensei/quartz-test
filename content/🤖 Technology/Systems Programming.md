Systems programming, as opposed to application programming, aims to produce software and software platforms which provide services to other software. Because of this, systems programming is often performance constrained, low-level, and requires a great deal of hardware awareness.

Examples of languages used for systems programming is [[C++ (Language)]] and [[Rust (Language)]]. 

> Systems programming is for:
> - Operating systems
> - Device drivers of all kinds
> - Filesystems
> - Databases
> - Code that runs in very cheap devices, or devices that must be extremely reliable
> - Cryptography
> - Media codecs (software for reading and writing audio, video, and image files)
> - Media processing (for example, speech recognition or photo editing software)
> - Memory management (for example, implementing a garbage collector)
> - Text rendering (the conversion of text and fonts into pixels)
> - Implementing higher-level programming languages (like JavaScript and Python)
> - Networking
> - Virtualization and software containers
> - Scientific simulations
> - Games
> 
> In short, systems programming is _resource-constrained_ programming. It is programming when every byte and every CPU cycle counts. [^1]
