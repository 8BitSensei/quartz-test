# Private cloud
A Private cloud, is a cloud that is used by *a single entity*, it provides much greater control for the consumer, but at a greater cost than other models. It may be hosted from your own or a dedicated datacentre, providing obvious security benefits, but carrying a great deal on infrastructural responsibilities.

# Public cloud
A public cloud is built and controlled by a third-party cloud provider, anyone can purchase cloud services and use resources from the provider. This is the key difference between it and the Private cloud model, shifting responsibility for infrastructure management away from the consumer, to the provider.

# Hybrid cloud
A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both a Public and Private cloud in an inter-connected environment. The nature, and benefits of a hybrid cloud depends on how you implement the specific cloud, but a common benefit is allowing services in a private cloud to handle surging demand by deploying to a public cloud, and then disabling that infrastructure after the surge has passed.

| No capital expenditures to scale up                                   | Organizations have complete control over resources and security | Provides the most flexibility                                     |
| Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned             | Data is not collocated with other organizationsâ€™ data           | Organizations determine where to run their applications           |
| Organizations pay only for what they use                              | Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance          | Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements |
| Organizations don't have complete control over resources and security | Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates                                                                |                                                                   |
