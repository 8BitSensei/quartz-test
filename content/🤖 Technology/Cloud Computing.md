Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Including common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking Cloud services can also expand the traditional IT offerings to include [[Internet of Things (IoT)]], [[Machine Learning (ML)]], and [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]].

Cloud computing doesn't have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is, meaning, that if you need to rapidly expand you infrastructure you don't have to build a new datacenter - you just extend the services from your cloud provider.

Fundamentally, the Cloud, is different from traditional datacenters, except they are owned by a provider you contract services from and abstract away much of the infrastructure responsibility. The Cloud, is really just a business model.
