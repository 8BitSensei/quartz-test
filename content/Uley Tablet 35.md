Here I re-produce Tomlin's transcription of Uley Tablet 35 as best I can in Markdown format. Tomlin understands it not to be Latin, but likely what he circumspectly assigns '*Celtic*'. It is well preserved, Old Roman Cursive, but unfortunately there is no word-separation, making it difficult to interpret [^1]. In personal communications with those more knowledgable than me on the Celtic Languages server, it was asserted that this more than likely Brittonic. Bernard Mees' talk at 2024 International Congress of Celtic Studies in Utrecht [^2] apparently assessed this and other texts, and interpreted it as a south-western dialect he calls '*Dobunnic*'. But this is unpublished so I cannot say if it is a convincing argument or not.
