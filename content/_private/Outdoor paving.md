Dig a level space of a depth of 100mm + the depth of your slabs. You will then want to measure out with pegs a slope away from the house at a rate of 10mm per metre.

Once the area is excavated and leveled out apply weed killer and then weed suppressant fabric. Next, 50 mm of sub-base gravel or rubble that you will then compress into a firm layer that will form our solid base. Next, is a 50mm layer of sharp sand, or builders sand, we will wet this before laying our slabs so that they stick to the sand and keep them solid.

Lay your slabs, starting at the house and working your way out. Spread fancy gravel in the gaps and remove any retaining edges.
